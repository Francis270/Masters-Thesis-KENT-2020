when an abortion can be carried out
most abortions in england, wales and scotland are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy.they can be carried out after 24 weeks in very limited circumstances – for example, if the mother's life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability.most abortion services will ask to perform an ultrasound scan to work out how many weeks pregnant you are. the length of pregnancy is calculated from the first day of your last period.abortions are safer the earlier they're carried out. getting advice early on will give you more time to make a decision if you're unsure.


deciding to have an abortion
