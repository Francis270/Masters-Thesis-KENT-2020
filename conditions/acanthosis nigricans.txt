non-urgent advice:  see a gp if you have:
      





new dark patches on your skin
any skin changes you're unsure about

although it's usually harmless, it's best to get any skin changes checked out. 
in rare cases, it can be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer.
a gp can usually tell if it's acanthosis nigricans by looking at your skin. 
you may need some tests if they're not sure what's causing the patches.

causes of acanthosis nigricans
the most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is being very overweight.
other causes include:

type 2 diabetes
conditions that affect hormone levels – such as cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid
taking certain medicines – including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill
in rare cases, cancer – usually stomach cancer
in rare cases, a faulty gene inherited from your parents

sometimes acanthosis nigricans happens in healthy people with no other conditions. this is more common in people with dark skin.



treating acanthosis nigricans
once your gp knows what's causing the condition, they can recommend the best treatment. 
the patches should fade over time once the cause is treated.
if you're very overweight, your gp may recommend losing weight.
depending on the cause, they may also recommend: 

medicine to balance your hormones 
medicine to balance your insulin levels
changing your medicine to one that doesn't cause the patches

there's no specific treatment for the patches. a skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.
