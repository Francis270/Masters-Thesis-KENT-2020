actinomycosis






actinomycosis is a rare type of bacterial infection. it can be very serious but can usually be cured with antibiotics.



treatment for actinomycosis
actinomycosis is treated with antibiotics. treatment starts off in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).
when you're well enough to go home, you'll be given tablets to take for a few months.
it's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better.
you might also need surgery to drain areas of pus (abscesses) and cut out the surrounding area if it's infected.







non-urgent advice:  contact your gp or specialist if:
      





your symptoms get worse or don't improve after leaving hospital

get help quickly if treatment doesn't seem to be working. the infection can spread to other parts of your body and can be life-threatening.

how you get actinomycosis
the bacteria that cause actinomycosis normally live harmlessly in the body. they only cause an infection if they get into the lining of areas such as the mouth or gut.
you can't spread the infection to other people.
any part of the body can be infected. where it starts depends on what caused it.
