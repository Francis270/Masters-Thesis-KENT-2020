age-related macular degeneration (amd) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision. it usually first affects people in their 50s and 60s.
it doesn't cause total blindness. but it can make everyday activities like reading and recognising faces difficult.
without treatment, your vision may get worse. this can happen gradually over several years ("dry amd"), or quickly over a few weeks or months ("wet amd").
the exact cause is unknown. it's been linked to smoking, high blood pressure, being overweight and having a family history of amd.
