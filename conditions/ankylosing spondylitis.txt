complications of ankylosing spondylitisthe outlook for as is highly variable. for some people the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others it can get progressively worse over time.some people with as are able to remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long-term.however, some people eventually become severely disabled as a result of the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees.with modern treatments, as does not normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems.for example, as can lead to:weakening of the bones (osteoporosis)spinal fracturescardiovascular disease – a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vesselschest infectionsrarely, kidney diseaseread about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis.
