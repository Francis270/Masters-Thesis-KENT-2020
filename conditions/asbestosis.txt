asbestosis






asbestosis is a serious lung condition caused by long-term exposure to asbestos.asbestos is a fibre-like material that was once used in buildings for insulation, flooring and roofing. its use has been fully banned in the uk since 1999.while asbestos can be dangerous, it's not harmful if left alone. but if material containing asbestos is damaged, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.when the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time.but you would need long-term exposure to asbestos fibres, usually over many years, before you develop asbestosis.
