this can cause:

blurred vision
headaches
eye strain (you may notice this after concentrating for a long time – on a computer, for example)

astigmatism normally occurs alongside short sight or long sight.
in young children, a high astigmatism may cause lazy eye. it's important this is spotted early so it can be treated.
