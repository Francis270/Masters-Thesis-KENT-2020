bacterial vaginosis







bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge. bv is not a sexually transmitted infection (sti), but it can increase your risk of getting an sti such as chlamydia.




check if you have bacterial vaginosis
the most common symptom of bacterial vaginosis is unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell, particularly after sex.you may notice a change to the colour and consistency of your discharge, such as becoming greyish-white and thin and watery.but 50% of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms.bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.


if you're unsure it's bv, check for other causes of unusual vaginal discharge.







non-urgent advice:  see a gp or go to a sexual health clinic if you think you have bv
      




the condition is not usually serious, but you'll need to be treated with antibiotics if you do have bv.it's also important to seek treatment if you're pregnant as there's a small chance that bv can cause complications with pregnancy.

what causes bacterial vaginosis
bacterial vaginosis is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina.what causes this to happen is not fully known, but you're more likely to get it if:you're sexually active (but women who have not had sex can also get bv)you have had a change of partneryou have an iud (contraception device)you use perfumed products in or around your vaginabv is not an sti, even though it can be triggered by sex.a woman can pass it to another woman during sex.you're more likely to get an sti if you have bv. this may be because bv makes your vagina less acidic and reduces your natural defences against infection.
