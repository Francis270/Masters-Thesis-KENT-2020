how to get rid of bedbugs



do





contact your local council or pest control service – it's unlikely you'll be able to get rid of bedbugs yourself because they can be resistant to some insecticides





wash affected bedding and clothing – use a hot wash (60c) or tumble dry on a hot setting for at least 30 minutes





put affected clothing and bedding in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer (-16c) for 4 days (alternative to hot washing)





clean and vacuum regularly – bedbugs are found in both clean and dirty places, but regular cleaning will help you spot them early




don't






do not keep clutter around your bed






do not bring secondhand furniture indoors without carefully checking it first






do not take luggage or clothing indoors without checking it carefully if you have come from somewhere where you know there were bedbugs
