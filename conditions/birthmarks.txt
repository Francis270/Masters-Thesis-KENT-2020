treatment for birthmarks
most birthmarks do not need treatment, but some do. this is why it's important to get a birthmark checked if you're worried about it.a birthmark can be removed on the nhs if it's affecting a person's health. if you want a birthmark removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll have to pay to have it done privately.possible treatments for birthmarks include:medicines – to reduce blood flow to the birthmark, which can slow down its growth and make it lighter in colourlaser therapy – where heat and light are used to make the birthmark smaller and lighter (it works best if started between 6 months and 1 year of age)surgery – to remove the birthmark (but it can leave scarring)
