causes of cyanosis
blue lips, skin, tongue (central cyanosis)
blue or blue/grey skin on the face or over most of the body is usually a sign there's not enough oxygen in the blood because of a problem with the:

lungs – like asthma or pneumonia
airway – choking, or croup
heart 
seizures (fits) that last a long time

blue hands, feet, limbs (peripheral cyanosis)
the limbs will also usually feel cold.  
it happens when blood circulation is poor because of:

raynaud's phenomenon – where the blood supply to the fingers and toes becomes temporarily reduced 
an artery problem that affects the blood supply to the legs
beta-blockers, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure
a blood clot that stops the blood supply to or from a limb

sometimes it can also be caused by:

being in cold air or water
being at high altitude




treatment for cyanosis
cyanosis is a symptom of many different conditions. 
treatment depends on the cause.
