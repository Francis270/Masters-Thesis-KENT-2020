signs and symptoms of bone cancerbone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.the main symptoms include:persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the nightswelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a jointa noticeable lump over a bonea weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normalif you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your gp. while it's highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.read more about the symptoms of bone cancer.



types of bone cancersome of the main types of bone cancer are:osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20ewing sarcoma – which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop.the above types of bone cancer affect different types of cell. the treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.



what causes bone cancer?in most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer.you're more at risk of developing it if you:have had previous exposure to radiation during radiotherapyhave a condition known as paget's disease of the bone – however, only a very small number of people with paget's disease will actually develop bone cancerhave a rare genetic condition called li-fraumeni syndrome – people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cellsread more about the causes of bone cancer.



how bone cancer is treatedtreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.most people have a combination of:surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, but amputation is sometimes necessarychemotherapy – treatment with powerful cancer-killing medicationradiotherapy – where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cellsin some cases of osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may also be recommended.read more about treating bone cancer.



outlookthe outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn't spread.overall, around 6 in every 10 people with bone cancer will live for at least 5 years from the time of their diagnosis, and many of these may be cured completely.cancer research uk has more detailed statistics broken down by the different types of bone cancer, see the page on statistics and outlook for bone cancer.
