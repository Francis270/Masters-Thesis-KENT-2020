bowel cancer screeningto detect cases of bowel cancer sooner, the nhs offers 2 types of bowel cancer screening to adults registered with a gp in england:all men and women aged 60 to 74 are invited to carry out a fit or fob test. every 2 years, they're sent a home test kit, which is used to collect a poo sample. if you're 75 or over, you can ask for this test by calling the freephone helpline on 0800 707 60 60.an additional one-off test called bowel scope screening is gradually being introduced in england. this is offered to men and women at the age of 55. it involves a doctor or nurse looking inside the lower part of the bowel using a camera on the end of a thin, flexible tube.taking part in bowel cancer screening reduces your chances of dying from bowel cancer. removing any polyps – small growths that can develop on the inner lining of your bottom (rectum) – found in bowel scope screening can prevent cancer.however, all screening involves a balance of potential harms, as well as benefits. it's up to you to decide if you want to have it.read about bowel cancer screening, including more about what the 2 tests involve, what the different possible results mean, and the potential risks to weigh up.



treatment for bowel cancerbowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.the main treatments are:surgery – the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it's the most effective way of curing bowel cancer and in many cases is all you needchemotherapy – where medicine is used to kill cancer cellsradiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cellstargeted therapies – a newer group of medicines that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreadingas with most types of cancer, the chance of a complete cure depends on how far it's spread by the time it's diagnosed. if the cancer is confined to the bowel, surgery is usually able to completely remove it.keyhole or robotic surgery is being used more often, which allows surgery to be performed with less pain and a quicker recovery.read more about how bowel cancer is treated.
