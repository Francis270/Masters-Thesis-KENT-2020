typesthere are lots of types of brain tumour. they have different names depending on where they are in the brain.they're also given a number from 1 to 4, known as the grade.the higher the number, the more serious a tumour is:grade 1 and 2 brain tumours are non-cancerous (benign) tumours that tend to grow quite slowlygrade 3 and 4 brain tumours are cancerous (malignant) tumours that grow more quickly and are more difficult to treatbrain tumours are also called primary (which start in the brain) and secondary (which spread to the brain).cancer research uk has more on types of brain tumours.



treatmentstreatment for a brain tumour aims to remove as much of it as possible and try to stop it coming back.the main treatments are:surgery – a small section of skull is removed and the tumour is cut out before the piece of skull is fixed back in placeradiotherapy – radiation from an external machine is used to kill cancer cells after surgerychemotherapy – medicine is used to kill cancer cells after surgery, or relieve symptoms if the tumour can't be removedradiosurgery – lots of tiny beams of radiation are aimed at the cancer to kill it if you can't have surgerycarmustine implants (glial wafers) – a new way of giving chemotherapy for some high-grade tumours, where implants are inserted into the brain (read more about carmustine implant treatment)medicines may also be used to relieve symptoms like headaches, seizures and vomiting.



outlookthe outlook for a malignant brain tumour depends on things like where it is in the brain, its size, and what grade it is.it can sometimes be cured if caught early on, but a brain tumour often comes back and sometimes it isn't possible to remove it.speak to your care team if you'd like to know what the outlook is for you, as it varies from person to person.you can also find general survival statistics for brain tumours on the cancer research uk website.
