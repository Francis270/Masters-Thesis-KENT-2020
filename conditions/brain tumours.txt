brain tumours







a brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way.


grades and types of brain tumour
brain tumours are graded according to how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.grade 1 and 2 tumours are low grade, and grade 3 and 4 tumours are high grade.there are 2 main types of brain tumours:non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours – these are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatmentcancerous (malignant) brain tumours – these are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatmentthe cancer research uk website also has more information about specific types of brain tumours.



symptoms of a brain tumour
the symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain affected.common symptoms include:headaches, which can be dull and constant, or throbbingseizures (fits)persistently feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and drowsinessmental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personalityprogressive weakness or paralysis on 1 side of the bodyvision or speech problemssometimes you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may develop very slowly over time.


when to see a gp
see a gp if you have these types of symptoms, particularly if you have a headache that feels different from the type of headache you usually get, or if headaches are getting worse.you may not have a brain tumour, but these types of symptoms should be checked.if your gp cannot identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a doctor who specialises in the brain and nervous system (neurologist) for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.


who's affected
brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.more than 11,000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour in the uk each year, of which about half are cancerous. many others are diagnosed with a secondary brain tumour.



causes and risks
the cause of most brain tumours is unknown, but there are several risk factors which may increase your chances of developing a brain tumour.risk factors include:age – the risk of getting a brain tumour increases with age (most brain tumours happen in older adults aged 85 to 89), although some types of brain tumour are more common in childrenradiation – exposure to radiation accounts for a very small number of brain tumours; some types of brain tumours are more common in people who have had radiotherapy, ct scans or x-rays of the headfamily history and genetic conditions – some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of getting a brain tumour, including tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and turner syndrome

treating brain tumours
if you have a brain tumour, your treatment will depend on:the type of tumourwhere it is in your brainhow big it is and how far it's spreadhow abnormal the cells areyour overall health and fitnesstreatments for brain tumours include:steroidsmedicines to help with symptomssurgeryradiotherapychemotherapyafter being diagnosed with a brain tumour, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumour.other medicines can be used to help with other symptoms of brain tumours, such as anti-epileptic medicines for seizures and painkillers for headaches.surgery is often used to remove brain tumours. the aim is to remove as much abnormal tissue as safely as possible.it's not always possible to remove all of a tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed to treat any abnormal cells left behind.treatment for non-cancerous tumours is often successful and a full recovery is possible.sometimes there's a small chance the tumour could return, so you may need regular follow-up appointments to monitor this.
