things you can do yourself
broken or bruised ribs heal in the same way and usually get better by themselves within 3 to 6 weeks.there are some things you can do to help ease pain and speed up healing:

do





take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – avoid taking ibuprofen for 48 hours after your injury as it may slow down healing





hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas in a tea towel) to the affected ribs regularly in the first few days to bring down swelling





rest and take time off work if you need to





breathe normally and cough when you need to – this helps clear mucus from your lungs to prevent chest infections





if you need to cough, hold a pillow against your chest





walk around and sometimes move your shoulders to help you breathe and clear mucus from your lungs





take 10 slow, deep breaths every hour to help clear your lungs





try to sleep more upright for the first few nights




don't






do not wrap a bandage tightly around your chest to stop your lungs expanding properly






do not lie down or stay still for a long time






do not strain yourself or lift heavy objects






do not play any sports or do any exercise that makes your pain worse






do not smoke – stopping smoking may also help your recovery
