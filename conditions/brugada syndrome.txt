brugada syndrome






brugada syndrome is a rare but serious condition that affects the way electrical signals pass through the heart.it can cause the heart to beat dangerously fast. these unusually fast heartbeats – known as an arrhythmia – can sometimes be life threatening.brugada syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene that's inherited by a child from a parent. a simple heart test can be done to see if you have it.



symptoms of brugada syndromemany people with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms and do not realise they have it.some people experience:blackoutsfits (seizures)occasional noticeable heartbeats (palpitations), chest pain, breathlessness, or dizzinessyou can get symptoms at any time, but they are sometimes triggered by something such as a high temperature, drinking lots of alcohol, or dehydration.symptoms often first appear during adulthood, but they can happen at any age. they're more common in men than women or children.

tests for brugada syndromethe main test for brugada syndrome is as an electrocardiogram (ecg). it checks the heart's electrical activity and is usually done in hospital.during an ecg, small sensors are attached to your arms, legs and chest. they're connected to a machine that measures the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.a medicine called ajmaline or flecainide may be given into a vein during the test to see how it affects your heart. this can help show up the unusual heartbeats caused by brugada syndrome.you may also have a blood test to look for one of the faulty genes that causes brugada syndrome.read about genetic testing.



treatments for brugada syndromethere's currently no cure for brugada syndrome, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk of experiencing serious problems.if your doctor thinks your risk of developing a dangerously fast heartbeat is low, you might not need any treatment at first.avoid triggersyou can reduce your risk of developing a fast heartbeat by avoiding things that can trigger it, including:a high temperature – if you develop a high temperature, take painkillers such as paracetamol to bring it down; get medical advice as soon as possible if this does not helpdrinking too much alcohol – avoid drinking lots of alcohol in a short space of timedehydration – get medical advice if you have diarrhoea or you keep being sick, as you may lose a lot of fluid and may need to take special rehydration drinkscertain medicines – make sure any healthcare professional you see knows you have brugada syndrome, and avoid medicines that can trigger the condition unless they're recommended by a doctor – the brugadadrugs.org website has more information about medicines that could act as possible triggersask your specialist about other things you may need to avoid or look out for.implanted defibrillatorif there's a high risk you could develop a dangerously fast heartbeat, your specialist may recommend having an implantable cardiac defibrillator (icd) fitted.an icd is a small device placed in the chest, similar to a pacemaker. if it senses your heart is beating at a dangerous speed, it sends out an electric shock to help it return to normal.an icd does not prevent a fast heartbeat, but can help stop it becoming life threatening.read more about out how an icd is fitted.
