cirrhosis is scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. the scar tissue prevents the liver working properly.cirrhosis is sometimes called end-stage liver disease because it happens after other stages of damage from conditions that affect the liver, such as hepatitis.your liver may keep working even when you have cirrhosis. however, cirrhosis can eventually lead to liver failure, and you can get serious complications, which can be life threatening.treatment may be able to stop cirrhosis from getting worse.

how to prevent cirrhosis
limit alcoholthe best way to prevent alcohol-related cirrhosis is to drink within the recommended limits.the guidelines recommend:men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a weekyou should spread your drinking over 3 days, or more, if you drink as much as 14 units a weekstop drinking alcohol immediately if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis. drinking alcohol speeds up the rate at which cirrhosis progresses, regardless of the cause.a gp can offer help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink. read more about where to get alcohol support.protect yourself from hepatitishepatitis b and c are infections in the liver caused by a virus.the hepatitis b virus is spread in blood and body fluids. the hepatitis c virus is usually spread in blood.common ways of spreading these viruses include having sex with an infected person without using a condom, or close contact with an infected person's blood, such as sharing their toothbrush or sharing needles to inject drugs.vaccination for hepatitis b is part of the nhs childhood vaccination schedule. the vaccine is also available to anyone who has an increased chance of getting hepatitis b.there is no vaccine for hepatitis c at the moment.aim for a healthy weightto reduce your chance of getting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld), which can lead to cirrhosis, make sure you're a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly.


the liver
the liver is an important organ that does hundreds of jobs that are vital for sustaining life.for example, the liver:stores glycogen, a type of fuel the body needs for energymakes bile, which helps us digest fatsmakes substances that help blood to clot and repair damaged tissuesprocesses and removes alcohol, toxins or medicines from the bloodhelps the body fight infectionsyour liver is very tough. it'll keep working even when it's damaged and can continue to repair itself until it's severely damaged.
