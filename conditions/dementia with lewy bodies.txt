causes of dementia with lewy bodiesdementia with lewy bodies is caused by clumps of protein forming inside brain cells. these abnormal deposits are called lewy bodies.these deposits are also found in people with parkinson's disease, and they build up in areas of the brain responsible for functions such as thinking, visual perception and muscle movement.it's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain. it's thought that part of the problem is the proteins affecting the brain's normal functions by interfering with signals sent between brain cells.dementia with lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been very rare cases that seem to run in families.
