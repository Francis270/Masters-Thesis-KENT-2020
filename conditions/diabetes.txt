diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.there are 2 main types of diabetes:type 1 diabetes – where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulintype 2 diabetes – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulintype 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. in the uk, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.during pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. this is known as gestational diabetes.

causes of diabetesthe amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).when food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.however, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. this is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes.you can help manage type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.read about how to reduce your diabetes risk.
