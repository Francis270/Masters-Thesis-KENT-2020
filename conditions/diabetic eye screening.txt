eye problems caused by diabetes are called diabetic retinopathy. this can lead to sight loss if it's not found early.
the eye screening test can find problems before they affect your sight.
pictures are taken of the back of your eyes to check for any changes.
if you have diabetes and you're aged 12 or over, you'll get a letter asking you to have your eyes checked at least once a year.
