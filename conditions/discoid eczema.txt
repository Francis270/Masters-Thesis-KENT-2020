the first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small spots or bumps on the skin. these then quickly join up to form larger patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.on lighter skin these patches will be pink or red. on darker skin these patches can be a dark brown or they can be paler than the skin around them.initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. they also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. the centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm.you may just have 1 patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. the skin between the patches is often dry.patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. signs of an infection can include:the patches oozing a lot of fluida yellow crust developing over the patchesthe skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painfulfeeling sickfeeling hot or shiveryfeeling unwell



when to seek medical advicesee a pharmacist or gp if you think you may have discoid eczema. they can recommend a suitable treatment.you should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected. you may need to use an antibiotic cream or, in severe cases, take antibiotics as a tablet or capsule.a gp should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. in some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions.a gp may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test.



causes of discoid eczemathe cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin.when your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. this could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin.it's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema.some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema, which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. however, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.other possible triggers an outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn.some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking:interferon and ribavirin – when they're used together to treat hepatitis ctumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) blockers – used to treat some types of arthritisstatins (cholesterol-lowering medicine) – which can cause dry skin and rashesdry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse, and sunny or damp (humid) environments may make your symptoms better.
