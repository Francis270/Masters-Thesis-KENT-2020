encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed (swollen).it can be life threatening and requires urgent treatment in hospital.anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk.




symptoms of encephalitis
encephalitis sometimes starts off with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and headache.more serious symptoms come on over hours, days or weeks, including:confusion or disorientationseizures or fitschanges in personality and behaviourdifficulty speakingweakness or loss of movement in some parts of the bodyloss of consciousnessdial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has these more serious symptoms.



causes of encephalitisit's not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by:viral infections – several common viruses can spread to the brain and cause encephalitis in rare cases, including the herpes simplex virus (which causes cold sores and genital herpes) and the chickenpox virusa problem with the immune system, the body's defence against infection – sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamedbacterial or fungal infections – these are much rarer causes of encephalitis than viral infectionssome types of encephalitis are spread by mosquitoes (such as japanese encephalitis), ticks (such as tick-borne encephalitis) and mammals (such as rabies).you cannot catch encephalitis from someone else.




treatments for encephalitis
encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. the earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be.treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include:antiviral medicinessteroid injectionstreatments to help control the immune systemantibiotics or antifungal medicinespainkillers to reduce discomfort or a high temperaturemedicine to control seizures or fitssupport with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator)how long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months.



recovering from encephalitissome people eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process.many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems caused by damage to their brain.common complications include:memory lossfrequent seizures or fitspersonality and behavioural changesproblems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solvingpersistent tirednessthese problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends.but help and support is available.




preventing encephalitis
it's not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations.these include the:measles, mumps and rubella (mmr) vaccine – a routine vaccination offered to all children in englandjapanese encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas, such as parts of asiatick-borne encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to certain parts of europe (but not the uk) and asiarabies vaccination – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas where access to medical care is likely to be limitedspeak to a gp surgery if you're not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you're planning to travel abroad and do not know if you need any vaccinations.
