causes of epilepsy
in epilepsy, the electrical signals in the brain become scrambled and there are sometimes sudden bursts of electrical activity. this is what causes seizures.in most cases, it's not clear why this happens. it's possible it could be partly caused by your genes affecting how your brain works, as around 1 in 3 people with epilepsy have a family member with it.occasionally, epilepsy can be caused by damage to the brain, such as damage from:a strokea brain tumoura severe head injurydrug abuse or alcohol misusea brain infectiona lack of oxygen during birth
