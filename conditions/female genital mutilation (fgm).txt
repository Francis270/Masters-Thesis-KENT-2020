types of fgmthere are 4 main types of fgm:type 1 (clitoridectomy) – removing part or all of the clitoristype 2 (excision) – removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (the lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (the larger outer lips)type 3 (infibulation) – narrowing the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labiaother harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the areafgm is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. but in some countries it may be done by a medical professional.anaesthetics and antiseptics are not generally used, and fgm is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.fgm often happens against a girl's will without her consent, and girls may have to be forcibly restrained.



effects of fgmthere are no health benefits to fgm and it can cause serious harm, including:constant painpain and difficulty having sexrepeated infections, which can lead to infertilitybleeding, cysts and abscessesproblems peeing or holding pee in (incontinence)depression, flashbacks and self-harmproblems during labour and childbirth, which can be life threatening for mother and babysome girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result of the procedure.fgm and sexfgm can make it difficult and painful to have sex. it can also result in reduced sexual desire and a lack of pleasurable sensation.talk to your gp or another healthcare professional if you have sexual problems that you feel may be caused by fgm, as they can refer you to a special therapist who can help.in some cases, a surgical procedure called a deinfibulation may be recommended, which can alleviate and improve some symptoms.fgm and pregnancysome women with fgm may find it difficult to become pregnant, and those who do conceive can have problems in childbirth.if you're expecting a baby, your midwife should ask you if you have had fgm at your antenatal appointment.it's important to tell your midwife if you think this has happened to you so they can arrange appropriate care for you and you baby.fgm and mental healthfgm can be an extremely traumatic experience that can cause emotional difficulties throughout life, including;depressionanxietyflashbacks to the time of the cuttingnightmares and other sleep problemsin some cases, women may not remember having the fgm at all, especially if it was performed when they were an infant.talk to a gp or another healthcare professional if you're experiencing emotional or mental health problems that may be a result of fgm. help and support is available.



treatment for fgm (deinfibulation)surgery can be performed to open up the vagina, if necessary. this is called deinfibulation.it's sometimes known as a reversal, although this name is misleading as the procedure does not replace any removed tissue and will not undo the damage caused. but it can help many problems caused by fgm.surgery may be recommended for:women who are unable to have sex or have difficulty peeing as a result of fgmpregnant women at risk of problems during labour or delivery as a result of fgmdeinfibulation should be carried out before getting pregnant, if possible.it can be done in pregnancy or labour if necessary, but ideally should be done before the last 2 months of pregnancy.the surgery involves making a cut (incision) to open the scar tissue over the entrance to the vagina.it's usually performed under local anaesthetic in a clinic and you will not normally need to stay overnight.a small number of women need either a general anaesthetic or an injection in the back (epidural), which may involve a short stay in hospital.

why fgm is carried outfgm is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it'll benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to preserve her virginity).but there are no acceptable reasons that justify fgm. it's a harmful practice that has no health benefits.fgm usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had fgm themselves, or if their father comes from a community where it's carried out.



where fgm is carried outgirls are sometimes taken abroad for fgm, but they may not be aware this is the reason for their travel.girls are more at risk of fgm being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for them to "heal" before they return to school.if you think there's a risk of this happening to you, you can download the statement opposing fgm and take it with you on holiday to show your family.communities that perform fgm are found in many parts of africa, the middle east and asia.girls who were born in the uk or are resident here but whose families originate from an fgm-practising community are at greater risk of fgm happening to them.communities at particular risk of fgm in the uk originate from:egypteritreaethiopiagambiaguineaindonesiaivory coastkenyaliberiamalaysiamalinigeriasierra leonesomaliasudanyemen
