broadly, treatment works in 3 main steps:pain relief – avoid movements that cause you pain. only move your shoulder gently. use paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain.stronger pain and swelling relief – prescribed painkillers. maybe steroid injections in your shoulder to bring down the swelling.getting movement back – shoulder exercises once it's less painful. this can be at home or with a physiotherapist.you may get a mix of these treatments depending on how painful and stiff your shoulder is.stronger pain relief is usually only used for a short time because it can cause side effects.
