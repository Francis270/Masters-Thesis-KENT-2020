what causes gender dysphoria?the exact cause of gender dysphoria is unclear.gender development is complex and there are still things that are not known or fully understood.gender dysphoria is not related to sexual orientation. people with gender dysphoria may identify as straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual.



how common is gender dysphoria?no one really knows because not all people who have a sense of unease about their identity, or already identify as gender diverse, need or ask for support from the nhs.the number of people being referred and diagnosed with the condition has increased a lot over the last decade. in 2018/19 around 8,000 people were referred to adult gender dysphoria services in england.
