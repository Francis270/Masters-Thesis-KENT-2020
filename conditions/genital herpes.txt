what happens at a sexual health clinicthe doctor or nurse at the sexual health clinic will:ask about your symptoms and your sexual partnersuse a small cotton bud (swab) to take some fluid from 1 of your blisters or sores for testingthe test cannot:be done if you do not have visible blisters or sorestell you how long you have had herpes or who you got it fromsymptoms might not appear for weeks or even years after you're infected with the herpes virus.if you have genital herpes, your previous sexual partners should get tested.the doctor or nurse at the clinic can discuss this with you and help you tell your partners without letting them know it's you who has the virus.




treatment for genital herpes
there's no cure. symptoms clear up by themselves, but the blisters can come back (an outbreak or recurrence).treatment from a sexual health clinic can help.treatment the first time you have genital herpesyou may be prescribed:antiviral medicine to stop the symptoms getting worse – you need to start taking this within 5 days of the symptoms appearingcream for the painif you have had symptoms for more than 5 days before you go to a sexual health clinic, you can still get tested to find out the cause.treatment if the blisters come backgo to a gp or sexual health clinic if you have been diagnosed with genital herpes and need treatment for an outbreak.antiviral medicine may help shorten an outbreak by 1 or 2 days if you start taking it as soon as symptoms appear.but outbreaks usually settle by themselves, so you may not need treatment.recurrent outbreaks are usually milder than the first episode of genital herpes.over time, outbreaks tend to happen less often and be less severe. some people never have outbreaks.some people who have more than 6 outbreaks in a year may benefit from taking antiviral medicine for 6 to 12 months.if you still have outbreaks of genital herpes during this time, you may be referred to a specialist.




how to deal with outbreaks yourself
if you have been diagnosed with genital herpes and you're having an outbreak:

do





keep the area clean using plain or salt water to prevent blisters becoming infected





apply an ice pack wrapped in a flannel to soothe pain





apply petroleum jelly (such as vaseline) or painkilling cream (such as 5% lidocaine) to reduce pain when you pee





wash your hands before and after applying cream or jelly





pee while pouring water over your genitals to ease the pain




don't






do not wear tight clothing that may irritate blisters or sores






do not put ice directly on the skin






do not touch your blisters or sores unless you're applying cream






do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the sores have gone away







how genital herpes is passed on
genital herpes is very easy to pass on (contagious) from the first tingling or itching of a new outbreak (before any blisters appear) to when sores have fully healed.you can get genital herpes:from skin-to-skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex)when there are no visible sores or blistersif a cold sore touches your genitalsby transferring the infection on fingers from someone else to your genitalsby sharing sex toys with someone who has herpesyou cannot get genital herpes:from objects such as towels, cutlery or cups – the virus dies very quickly when away from your skin



protecting against genital herpesyou can reduce the chances of passing herpes on by:using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but herpes can still be passed on if the condom does not cover the infected areaavoiding vaginal, anal or oral sex if you or your partner has blisters or sores, or a tingle or itch that means an outbreak is comingnot sharing sex toys – if you do, wash them and put a condom on themwhy genital herpes comes backgenital herpes is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. once you have the virus, it stays in your body.it will not spread in your body to cause blisters elsewhere. it stays in a nearby nerve and causes blisters in the same area.if you can, avoid things that trigger your symptoms.triggers can include:ultraviolet light – for example, from sunbedsfriction in your genital area – for example, from sex (lubricant may help) or tight clothingsome triggers are unavoidable, including:being unwellhaving a periodsurgery on your genital areaa weakened immune system – for example, from having chemotherapy for cancer



genital herpes and hivgenital herpes can be a more serious condition for people with hiv.if you have hiv and herpes, you'll be referred to a genitourinary medicine (gum) specialist.



genital herpes and pregnancywomen with herpes before pregnancy can usually expect to have a healthy baby and a vaginal delivery.if you have genital herpes during pregnancy, there's a risk your baby could develop a serious illness called neonatal herpes.this can be fatal, but most babies recover with antiviral treatment.the risk of your baby getting neonatal herpes is low if you have had genital herpes before.it's higher if you get genital herpes for the first time in pregnancy.
