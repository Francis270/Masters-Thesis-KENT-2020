what happens at your appointmentthe gp should be able to tell if it's glue ear by looking for fluid inside the ear.they'll use a small scope with a light and magnifying glass. this should not be painful.if your child has had glue ear for more than 3 months, they may be referred to a specialist for hearing tests.hearing tests can help find out how severe any hearing loss is and what's causing it.




treatment for glue ear from a gp
glue ear is not always treated. the gp will usually wait to see if the symptoms get better on their own.this is because there's no effective medicine for glue ear, and it often clears up on its own within 3 months.your child may be monitored for up to a year in case their symptoms change or get worse.the gp may suggest trying a treatment called autoinflation while waiting for symptoms to improve. autoinflation can help fluid in the ear to drain.it's done by either:blowing up a special balloon using 1 nostril at a timeswallowing while holding the nostrils closedas autoinflation has to be done several times a day, it's not usually recommended for children under 3 years old.antibiotics may be prescribed if glue ear causes an ear infection.
