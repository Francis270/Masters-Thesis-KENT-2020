growing pains






growing pains are common in children, mainly in the legs. they're harmless, but can be very painful. they usually stop by around age 12.


check if it's growing pains
growing pains can come and go over months, even years.
the pain is usually:

an aching or throbbing in both legs
in the muscles, not the joints
in the evening or night-time (and goes away by morning)

growing pains are more common in active children and can come on after playing a lot of sports. 
they're also more common in children with flexible joints (double jointed).
