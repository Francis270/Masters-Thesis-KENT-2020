gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected.most adults in the uk have gum disease to some degree, and most people experience it at least once. it's much less common in children.if you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. this early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.if gingivitis is not treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. this affects the tissues that support teeth and hold them in place.if periodontitis is not treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.find out more about the symptoms of gum disease




what causes gum disease?
gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria.some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums.if you do not remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums.this can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness.
