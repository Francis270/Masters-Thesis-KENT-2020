haemochromatosis is an inherited condition where iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years.this build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. if it is not treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart.haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern european background and is particularly common in countries where lots of people have a celtic background, such as ireland, scotland and wales.

causes of haemochromatosishaemochromatosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects how the body absorbs iron from your diet.you're at risk of developing the condition if both of your parents have this faulty gene and you inherit 1 copy from each of them.you will not get haemochromatosis if you only inherit 1 copy of the faulty gene but there's a chance you could pass the faulty gene on to any children you have.and even if you do inherit 2 copies, you will not necessarily get haemochromatosis. only a small number of people with 2 copies of this faulty gene will ever develop the condition. it's not known exactly why this is.read more about the causes of haemochromatosis
