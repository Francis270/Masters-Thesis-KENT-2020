diagnosing hairy cell leukaemiaif a gp suspects you have leukaemia, they may refer you to a doctor who specialises in blood disorders (haematologist).a haematologist will arrange for blood tests to determine how many different types of blood cells there are in your blood sample. this is known as a full blood count (fbc).if you have hairy cell leukaemia, it's likely your red blood cell and platelet counts will be low.a sample of your bone marrow may also need to be taken for testing, which will give the haematologist more detailed information about your condition.an ultrasound scan or a ct scan may be needed to examine your spleen.
