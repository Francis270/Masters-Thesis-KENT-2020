there are several ways you can get your hearing tested if it's getting gradually worse.



how to get an nhs hearing test
you can get a free hearing test on the nhs. your gp may refer you to a hearing specialist (audiologist) who can do the test.
it could take a few weeks to see the specialist. so it will probably be quicker to get tested somewhere else, like at a large pharmacy or opticians, although you may have to pay for this.

always see a gp first if:

you also have other symptoms, like earache or discharge â€“ this could be something easily treatable like an earwax build-up or ear infection
you have sudden hearing loss in one ear
you're worried about your child's hearing
