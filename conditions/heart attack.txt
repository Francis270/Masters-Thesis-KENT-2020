treating heart attacks
while waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.in hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.the 2 main treatments are:using medicines to dissolve blood clotssurgery to help restore blood to the heart




causes of a heart attack
coronary heart disease (chd) is the leading cause of heart attacks.chd is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.the clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.



recovering from a heart attackthe time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.most people can return to work after having a heart attack. some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. other people may take several months to recover. how quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.the recovery process aims to:reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levelsgradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)find out more about recovering from a heart attack



complications of a heart attackcomplications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.these include:arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functionsheart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)these complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.the outlook often depends on:age – serious complications are more likely as you get olderthe severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attackhow long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possiblefind out more about complications of a heart attack
