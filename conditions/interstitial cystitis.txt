what causes interstitial cystitis?
the exact cause of interstitial cystitis is not clear. unlike other types of cystitis, there's no obvious infection in the bladder and antibiotics do not help.in some people with the condition, the bladder is inflamed, ulcerated, scarred or stiff.there are several theories about the possible cause of the condition.these include:damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding muscles and nervesa problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeingyour immune system mistakenly attacking your bladderan allergic reactionit's also been suggested that interstitial cystitis may be a symptom of a more widespread problem, as it's been associated with conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and lupus.

treatments for interstitial cystitis
unfortunately, there's currently no cure for interstitial cystitis and it can be difficult to treat, although a number of treatments can be tried.but no single treatment works for everyone, and there's disagreement about how effective some of them are.you may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you.medicines and other therapies may be used if lifestyle changes not help, and surgery may be necessary as a last resort.


medicinestablets or capsules may be used to treat people with interstitial cystitis.these include:over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofenover-the-counter antihistamines – such as loratadine and cetirizinestronger painkillers available on prescription – such as amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalintolterodine, solifenacin or mirabegron – these help relax the bladder musclescimetidine – a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine on cells in the bladderpentosan polysulfate sodium (elmiron) – this may help repair the bladder liningsome medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter.these are known as intravesical medications or bladder instillations.examples of intravesical medications include lignocaine, which is a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder, and hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate, which are medicines that may help restore the bladder lining.supportive therapies and treatmentssome people also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful:physiotherapy – massaging the pelvic floor muscles may help reduce any strain on your bladderbladder retraining – where you gradually learn to be able to hold more pee in your bladder before needing to go to the toiletpsychological therapy – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your lifetranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your bodysurgery and proceduressurgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work.procedures that may be carried out include:cauterisation – where ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laserbladder distension – where the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve your symptomsbotulinum toxin injections – where a substance called botulinum toxin (such as botox) is injected directly into your bladder to temporarily relieve your symptomsneuromodulation – where an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to peeaugmentation – making the bladder larger using part of the small intestine; this usually also includes removing any inflamed areas of the bladderin very rare cases, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy).if this is done, your surgeon will need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body.this will usually be through a small hole in your tummy called a stoma, but might involve making a new bladder using part of your small intestine (bladder reconstruction).
