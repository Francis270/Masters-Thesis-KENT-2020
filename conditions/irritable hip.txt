hip pain in children (irritable hip)






hip pain in children is most often caused by a condition called irritable hip, which usually gets better on its own. but it should always be checked because it could be a sign of something serious.







urgent advice: ask for an urgent gp appointment or go to a&e if your child:
      





gets sudden pain in their hip, thigh or knee (hip problems can sometimes be felt in the thigh or knee)
is limping or can't put any weight on 1 leg

they probably just have irritable hip (inflammation of the hip joint). this isn't serious and gets better by itself.
but they should be checked to rule out anything like a broken bone or infected joint (septic arthritis).
find an a&e department


what happens at your appointment
to find out what's causing your child's pain, a doctor or nurse may:

look at and feel your child's hip, leg or knee
try gently moving the leg in different directions
ask about any recent injuries or illnesses
arrange an x-ray 

sometimes a blood test or other scans may also be done to confirm it's nothing serious.



treatment for irritable hip
irritable hip normally gets better in 1 or 2 weeks and doesn't cause lasting problems.
you can usually look after your child at home. sometimes they may need to stay in hospital for a few days if they're in a lot of pain.
while looking after your child at home:

do





      ensure they rest their leg until they're feeling better – keep them off nursery or school until they're recovered
    




      give them ibuprofen or paracetamol for their pain
    




      attend any follow-up appointments recommended by your doctor or nurse
    



don't






      do not let them do any activities that could put a lot of strain on their hip for at least 2 weeks – they can gradually return to their normal activities once they're feeling better (swimming is a good way to get the joint moving again)
    






urgent advice: take your child back to the gp or hospital if:
      





their pain is getting worse
they get a high temperature or feel hot and shivery
their pain hasn't started to improve after a week
they're still in pain after 2 weeks
their pain went away but has come back

this might mean they have a more serious problem.
