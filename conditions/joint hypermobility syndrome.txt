joint hypermobility syndrome







hypermobility means your joints are more flexible than other people's (you may think of yourself as being double jointed). when this causes pain, it might be joint hypermobility syndrome.

can you…
points




bend a knee backwards

bend an elbow backwards
1


bend a thumb backwards on to your forearm
1


bend a little finger back more than 90 degrees
1


put hands flat on floor with knees straight

4 points = hypermobility likely4 points and pain in 4 or more joints for at least 3 months = joint hypermobility syndrome likelydoctors will also use more detailed beighton criteria to help their diagnosis.

what causes joint hypermobility syndrome
joint hypermobility syndrome usually runs in families and cannot be prevented.usually, the joints are loose and stretchy because the tissues that should make them stronger and support them are weak.the weakness is because the collagen that strengthens the tissues is different from other people's.most experts agree that joint hypermobility syndrome is part of a spectrum of hypermobility disorders, which includes ehlers-danlos syndrome. some people with hypermobility spectrum disorders do not have symptoms that affect their joints.
