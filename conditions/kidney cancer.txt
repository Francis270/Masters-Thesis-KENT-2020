symptoms of kidney cancerin many cases, there are no obvious symptoms at first and kidney cancer may only be found during tests for another condition or reason.if there are symptoms, they can include:blood in your pee – you may notice your pee is darker than usual or reddish in coloura persistent pain in your lower back or side, just below your ribsa lump or swelling in your side (although kidney cancer is often too small to feel)



when to get medical advicesee a gp if you have symptoms of kidney cancer.although it's unlikely you have cancer, it's important to get your symptoms checked out.the gp will ask about your symptoms and may test a sample of your urine to see if it contains blood or an infection.if necessary, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to find out what the problem is.



causes of kidney cancerthe exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but some things can increase your chances of getting it, including:obesity – a body mass index (bmi) of 30 or more (use the healthy weight calculator to find your bmi)smoking – the more you smoke, the greater the riskhigh blood pressure (hypertension)family history – you're more likely to get kidney cancer if you have a close relative with itsome inherited genetic conditions long-term dialysis – a treatment for chronic kidney disease where a machine does some of the jobs of the kidneyskeeping to a healthy weight, a healthy blood pressure and not smoking is the best way to reduce your chances of getting kidney cancer.



treatments for kidney cancerthe treatment for kidney cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of your body.the main treatments are:surgery to remove part or all of the affected kidney – this is the main treatment for most peoplecryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation – where the cancerous cells are destroyed by freezing or heatingbiological therapies – medicines that help stop the cancer growing or spreadingembolisation – a procedure to cut off the blood supply to the cancerradiotherapy – using high-energy radiation to target cancer cells and relieve symptoms



outlook for kidney cancerthe outlook for kidney cancer largely depends on how big the tumour is and how far it has spread by the time it's diagnosed.if the cancer is still small and has not spread beyond the kidney, surgery can often cure it. some small, slow growing cancers may not need treatment at first.a cure is not usually possible if the cancer has spread, although treatment can sometimes help keep it under control. some people become unwell quickly, but others may live for several years and feel well despite having kidney cancer.around 7 in 10 people live at least a year after diagnosis and around 5 in 10 live at least 10 years.cancer research uk has more information about survival statistics for kidney cancer.
