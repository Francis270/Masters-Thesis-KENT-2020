a liver transplant is an operation to remove your liver and replace it with a healthy one from a donor.it may be recommended if your liver has stopped working properly (liver failure) and other treatments cannot help.



what happenshaving a liver transplant involves 3 main stages:having an assessment – to find out if you're suitable for a liver transplant, you'll have several tests and will be asked about your health and lifestyle.going on the waiting list – if you're suitable for a transplant, you'll need to wait for a healthy donor liver to become available, which could take several months or more.having the operation – when a liver is available, you'll go into hospital for surgery to remove your damaged liver and replace it with the healthy donor one.this can be a long and difficult process, both physically and emotionally.
