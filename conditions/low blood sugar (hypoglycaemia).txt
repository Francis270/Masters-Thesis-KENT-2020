a low blood sugar, also called hypoglycaemia or a "hypo", is where the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood drops too low.it mainly affects people with diabetes, especially if you take insulin.a low blood sugar can be dangerous if it's not treated promptly, but you can usually treat it easily yourself.




symptoms of low blood sugar
a low blood sugar causes different symptoms for everybody. you'll learn how it makes you feel if you keep getting it, although your symptoms may change over time.early signs of a low blood sugar include:feeling hungrysweatingtingling lipsfeeling shaky or tremblingdizzinessfeeling tireda fast or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)becoming easily irritated, tearful, stroppy or moodyturning paleif not treated, you may then get other symptoms, such as:weaknessblurred visiondifficulty concentratingconfusionunusual behaviour, slurred speech or clumsiness (like being drunk)feeling sleepyfits (seizures)collapsing or passing outhypos can also occur while sleeping, which may wake you up during the night or cause headaches, tiredness or damp sheets (from sweat) in the morning.if you have a device to check your blood sugar level, a reading of less than 4mmol/l is too low and should be treated.




how to treat low blood sugar yourself
follow these steps if your blood sugar is less than 4mmol/l or you have hypo symptoms:have a sugary drink or snack – try something like a small glass of non-diet fizzy drink or fruit juice, a small handful of sweets, or 4 or 5 dextrose tablets.test your blood sugar after 10 to 15 minutes – if it's 4mmol or above and you feel better, move on to step 3. if it's still below 4mmol, treat again with a sugary drink or snack and take another reading in 10 to 15 minutes.eat your main meal (containing carbohydrate) if you're about to have it or have a carbohydrate-containing snack – this could be a slice of toast with spread, a couple of biscuits, or a glass of milk.you do not usually need to get medical help once you're feeling better if you only have a few hypos, but tell your diabetes team if you keep having them or if you stop having symptoms when your blood sugar goes low.


treating someone who's unconscious or very drowsyfollow these steps:put the person in the recovery position and do not put anything in their mouth – so they do not choke.give them an injection of glucagon medicine – if it's available and you know how to do it. call 999 for an ambulance if an injection is not available or you do not know how to do it.wait about 10 minutes if you have given them an injection – move on to step 4 if the person wakes up and starts to feel better. call 999 for an ambulance if they do not improve within 10 minutes.give them a sugary drink or snack, followed by a carbohydrate-containing snack – the drinks and snacks used to treat a low blood sugar yourself should work.tell your diabetes care team if you ever have a severe hypo that caused you to lose consciousness.treating someone having a fit (seizure)follow these steps if someone has a fit caused by low blood sugar:stay with them and stop them hurting themselves – lie them down on something soft and move them away from anything dangerous (like a road or hot cooker).give them a sugary snack once the fit stops – if the fit stops in a few minutes, treat them as you would treat a low blood sugar yourself once you're able to.call 999 for an ambulance if the fit lasts more than 5 minutestell your diabetes care team if you ever have a severe hypo that caused you to have a fit.
