who gets motor neurone disease and why
motor neurone disease is an uncommon condition that mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages.it's caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves called motor neurones.these cells gradually stop working over time. it's not known why this happens.having a close relative with motor neurone disease, or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia, can sometimes mean you're more likely to get it.but it does not run in families in most cases.


when to see a gp
see a gp if:you think you may have early symptoms of motor neurone disease – they'll consider other possible conditions and can refer you to a specialist, called a neurologist, if necessarya close relative has motor neurone disease or frontotemporal dementia and you're worried you may be at risk of it – they may refer you for genetic counselling to talk about your risk and the tests you can haveit's unlikely you have motor neurone disease, but getting a correct diagnosis as early as possible can help you get the care and support you need.


tests and diagnosis
it can be difficult to diagnose motor neurone disease in the early stages.there's no single test for it and several conditions cause similar symptoms.to help rule out other conditions, a neurologist may arrange:blood testsa scan of your brain and spinetests to measure the electrical activity in your muscles and nervesa lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) – when a thin needle is used to remove and test the fluid from within your spine

how it progresses
motor neurone disease gets gradually worse over time.moving around, swallowing and breathing get increasingly difficult, and treatments like a feeding tube or breathing air through a face mask may be needed.the condition eventually leads to death, but how long it takes to reach this stage varies a lot.a few people live for many years or even decades with motor neurone disease.you might prefer not to know how long you might live. speak to a gp or your care team if you want to find out more.
