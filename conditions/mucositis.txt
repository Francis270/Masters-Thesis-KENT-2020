mucositis






mucositis is when your mouth or gut is sore and inflamed. it's a common side effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer. it can be very unpleasant, but usually stops in a few weeks.



things you can do to help
if you're having cancer treatment, there are some things you can do to help prevent and ease mucositis.

do





      brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush at least twice a day
    




      floss once a day
    




      rinse your mouth with warm water (or water mixed with a bit of salt) several times a day 
    




      suck on crushed ice or ice lollies
    




      eat soft, moist foods (try adding gravy or sauces to meals)
    




      drink plenty of water
    




      chew sugar-free gum (this can help keep your mouth moist)
    



don't






      do not use mouthwashes from shops without speaking to a pharmacist, nurse or doctor â€“ they might irritate your mouth
    





      do not eat crunchy, rough or sharp foods like crisps
    





      do not eat hot, spicy or salty foods
    





      do not eat acidic foods like tomatoes, oranges or lemons
    





      do not drink hot drinks (like tea and coffee), fizzy drinks or alcohol
    





      do not smoke
    





      do not take painkillers without speaking to a pharmacist, nurse or doctor
    









non-urgent advice:  tell your care team if you're having cancer treatment and get:
      





a sore mouth
mouth ulcers
difficulty swallowing, eating or talking
a dry mouth and lips
diarrhoea, bleeding from your bottom, or pain when pooing

these are symptoms of mucositis. they usually begin around 1 to 2 weeks after starting cancer treatment.





treatments for mucositis
mucositis should get better within a few weeks of finishing cancer treatment.
your care team can offer treatments to ease it, such as:

mouthwashes that clean, numb and protect your mouth
painkillers
sprays or gels to keep your mouth moist (saliva substitutes)
medicines to stop diarrhoea or reduce soreness inside your bottom (rectum)



talking to others can help
you may also find it useful to chat to people in a similar situation or who have had cancer treatment before.
ask your care team about support groups in your area.
you could also try an online forum like:

cancer research uk: cancer chat
macmillan cancer support: online community
