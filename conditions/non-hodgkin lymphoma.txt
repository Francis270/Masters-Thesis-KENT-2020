non-hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.the lymphatic system is part of your immune system.clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.in non-hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands).the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.the most common symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. find out more about the symptoms of non-hodgkin lymphoma
