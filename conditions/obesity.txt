the term obese describes a person who's very overweight, with a lot of body fat.it's a common problem in the uk that's estimated to affect around 1 in every 4 adults and around 1 in every 5 children aged 10 to 11.




how to tell if you're obese
the most widely used method to check if you're a healthy weight is body mass index (bmi).bmi is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. you can use the nhs bmi healthy weight calculator to work out your score.for most adults, a bmi of:18.5 to 24.9 means you're a healthy weight25 to 29.9 means you're overweight30 to 39.9 means you're obese40 or above means you're severely obesebmi is not used to diagnose obesity because people who are very muscular can have a high bmi without much fat.but for most people, bmi is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight.a better measure of excess fat is waist size, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a bmi of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a bmi of 30 to 34.9).generally, men with a waist size of 94cm or more and women with a waist size of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.



risks of obesityit's very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing obvious physical changes, it can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions.these include:type 2 diabetescoronary heart diseasesome types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancerstrokeobesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression and low self-esteem.




causes of obesity
obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories, particularly those in fatty and sugary foods, than you burn off through physical activity. the excess energy is stored by the body as fat.obesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down at desks, on sofas or in cars.find out why sitting too much is bad for your healththere are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines.




treating obesity
the best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly.to do this, you should:eat a balanced calorie-controlled diet as recommended by a gp or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)join a local weight loss grouptake up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (2.5 to 5 hours) a weekeat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeatyou may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.if lifestyle changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended.if taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. your gp will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.in some cases, weight loss surgery may be recommended.

outlookthere's no quick fix for obesity. weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed.the healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight can also help.remember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.
