symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)
if you have ocd, you'll usually experience frequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.an obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters your mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease.a compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that you feel you need to do to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought.for example, someone with an obsessive fear of being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave their house.women can sometimes have ocd during pregnancy or after their baby is born. obsessions may include worrying about harming the baby or not sterilising feeding bottles properly. compulsions could be things such as repeatedly checking the baby is breathing.



getting help for obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)people with ocd are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed.ocd is a health condition like any other, so there's nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. having ocd does not mean you're "mad" and it's not your fault you have it.there are 2 main ways to get help:refer yourself directly to a psychological therapies service – find a psychological therapies service in your areasee a gp – they'll ask about your symptoms and can refer you to a local psychological therapies service if necessaryyou can also find mental health apps and tools in the nhs apps library.if you think a friend or family member may have ocd, try talking to them about your concerns and suggest they get help.it's unlikely ocd will get better without proper treatment and support.
