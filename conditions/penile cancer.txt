causes of penile cancerthe cause of penile cancer isn't known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it, including:carrying the human papilloma virus (hpv) – there are more than 100 types of hpv; some types cause genital wartsage – the condition rarely affects men under the age of 40 and is most common in men aged over 50smoking – chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your risk of getting penile cancerhaving phimosis – when the foreskin is difficult to retract, the chances of developing infections like balanitis increase; repeated infections are linked to a higher risk of developing some types of penile cancer as they can weaken your immune systemthe cancer research uk website has more information about the risks and causes of penile cancer.



diagnosing penile canceryour gp will ask you about any symptoms you have and when they occur. they'll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of penile cancer, and refer people for the right tests faster.to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected penile cancer, read the nice 2017 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.if your gp suspects penile cancer, they may refer you to a specialist. this is usually a urologist, a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary system and genitals.the specialist will ask about your symptoms and check your medical history. they may also check for any physical signs of penile cancer.a blood test may be carried out to check your general health and number of blood cells.to confirm a diagnosis of penile cancer, you may need to have a biopsy. a small tissue sample will be removed so it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells.



treating penile cancer treatment for penile cancer depends on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has spread.for example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (cis), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment usually involves either using a chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin.you'll usually have a skin graft after surgery.the main treatments for later-stage penile cancer are:surgeryradiotherapychemotherapysurgery involves removing the cancerous cells and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.in most cases, any physical changes to your penis after an operation can be corrected with reconstructive surgery.skin and muscle can be taken from elsewhere in the body to recreate a functioning penis.but with early diagnosis and modern surgical techniques, your surgeon will usually be able to preserve as much penile tissue as possible.as part of most treatments for penile cancer, the lymph glands (small organs that are part of the immune system) in the groin will be assessed to determine if the cancer has spread. in some cases, the lymph glands may need to be surgically removed.as with most types of cancer, the outlook for individual cases depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced at the time of diagnosis.want to know more?the cancer research uk website has more information about: staging penile cancertypes of treatment for cancer of the penisyou can also read about penile cancer on the male cancer website orchid or call the helpline on 0203 465 5766 (monday to friday, 9am to 5.30pm).
