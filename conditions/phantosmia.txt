    how to clean your nose with a salt water solution
    



boil a pint of water then leave it to cool.
mix a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water.
wash your hands.
stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it.
sniff some of the solution up one nostril at a time and let it run out of your nose. it might help to hold your other nostril closed with your finger as you sniff.
repeat these steps a few times to see if it helps.

you don't need to use all of the solution. make a fresh solution each day, don't re-use any left over from the day before.â€‹
