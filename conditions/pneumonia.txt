who's affectedpneumonia can affect people of any age, but it's more common, and can be more serious, in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly.people in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia.




what causes pneumonia
pneumonia is usually the result of a bacterial infection.as well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include:viral pneumonia – caused by a virus, such as coronavirusaspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemicalfungal pneumonia – rare in the uk and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune systemhospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumoniarisk groupsthe following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia:babies and very young childrenelderly peoplepeople who smokepeople with other health conditions, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver conditionpeople with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as flu, having hiv or aids, having chemotherapy, or taking medicine after an organ transplant



diagnosing pneumoniaa doctor may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest.further tests may be needed in some cases.pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the common cold, bronchitis and asthma.to help make a diagnosis, a doctor may ask you:whether you feel breathless or you're breathing faster than usualhow long you have had your cough, and whether you're coughing up mucus and what colour it isif the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or outa doctor may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.they may also listen to your chest by tapping it. lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs.if you have mild pneumonia, you probably will not need to have a chest x-ray or any other tests.you may need a chest x-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests, if your symptoms have not improved within 48 hours of starting treatment.




treating pneumonia
mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by:getting plenty of resttaking antibiotics if the pneumonia is likely to be caused by a bacterial infectiondrinking plenty of fluidsif you do not have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time.for at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital.this is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person's health and age.



complications of pneumoniacomplications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes.possible complications of pneumonia include:pleurisy – where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failurea lung abscess – a rare complication that's mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuseblood poisoning (sepsis) – also a rare but serious complicationyou'll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications.




preventing pneumonia
although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and are not passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading.for example, you should:cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneezethrow away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouthwash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objectsa healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. for example, you should stop smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection.excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia.people at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine.
