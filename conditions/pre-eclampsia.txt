who's affected?mild pre-eclampsia affects up to 6% of pregnancies, and severe cases develop in about 1 to 2% of pregnancies.there are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia, such as:having diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease before starting pregnancyhaving another condition, such as lupus or antiphospholipid syndromehaving developed the condition during a previous pregnancyother things that can slightly increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia include:having a family history of the conditionbeing over 40 years oldit having been at least 10 years since your last pregnancyexpecting multiple babies (twins or triplets)having a body mass index (bmi) of 35 or overif you have 2 or more of these together, your chances are higher.if you're thought to be at a high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, you may be advised to take a daily dose of low-dose aspirin from the 12th week of pregnancy until your baby is delivered.



what causes pre-eclampsia?although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it's thought to occur when there's a problem with the placenta, the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's.




treating pre-eclampsia
if you're diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, you should be referred for an assessment by a specialist, usually in hospital.while in hospital, you'll be monitored closely to determine how severe the condition is and whether a hospital stay is needed.the only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, so you'll usually be monitored regularly until it's possible for your baby to be delivered.this will normally be at around 37 to 38 weeks of pregnancy, but it may be earlier in more severe cases.at this point, labour may be started artificially (induced) or you may have a caesarean section.medication may be recommended to lower your blood pressure while you wait for your baby to be delivered.



complicationsalthough most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there's a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and her baby.there's a risk that the mother will develop fits called "eclampsia". these fits can be life threatening for the mother and baby, but they're rare.
