stammering, also sometimes referred to as stuttering, is a relatively common speech problem in childhood, which can persist into adulthood.

types of stammeringthere are 2 main types of stammering:developmental stammering – the most common type of stammering that happens in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing quicklyacquired or late-onset stammering – is relatively rare and happens in older children and adults as a result of a head injury, stroke or progressive neurological condition. it can also be caused by certain drugs, medicines, or psychological or emotional traumathe information here focuses on developmental stammering.



what causes stammering?it is not possible to say for sure why a child starts stammering, but it is not caused by anything the parents have done.developmental and inherited factors may play a part, along with small differences in how efficiently the speech areas of the brain are working.speech developmentspeech development is a complex process that involves communication between different areas of the brain, and between the brain and the muscles responsible for breathing and speaking.when every part of this system works well, the right words are spoken in the right order, with correct rhythm, pauses and emphasis.a child learning to construct simple sentences needs practice to develop the different speech areas in the brain and create the "wiring" (neural pathways) needed for the different parts to work well together.talking problems can happen if some parts of this developing system are not co-ordinated. this can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure.as the brain continues to develop, some of these problems resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children "grow out" of stammering.sex differences and genesstammering is more common in boys than girls. it is unclear why this is.genes are also thought to have a role. around 2 in 3 people who stammer have a family history of stammering, which suggests the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer.

who's affectedstudies suggest around 1 in 12 young children go through a phase of stammering.around 2 in 3 children who stammer will grow out of it, although it's difficult to predict when this will happen in a particular child.it's estimated that stammering affects around 1 in 100 adults, with men being around 3 to 4 times more likely to stammer than women.
