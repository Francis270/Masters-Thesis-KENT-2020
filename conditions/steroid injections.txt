who can have steroid injectionsmost people can have steroid injections.tell the doctor before having treatment if you:have had a steroid injection in the last few weeks – you usually need to wait at least 6 weeks between injectionsyou've had 3 steroid injections in the last year – doctors usually recommend no more than 3 injections in the same area in the space of 12 monthshave had an allergic reaction to steroids in the pasthave an infection (including eye infections)have recently had, or are about to have, any vaccinationsare pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a babyhave any other conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, high blood pressure, or problems with your liver, heart or kidneysare taking other medicines, such as anticoagulantssteroid injections may not always be suitable in these cases, although the doctor may recommend them if they think the benefits outweigh any risks.



how steroid injections worksteroids are a manmade version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, 2 small glands found above the kidneys.when injected into a joint or muscle, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation) in the nearby area. this can help relieve pain and stiffness.when injected into the blood, they can reduce inflammation throughout the body, as well as reduce the activity of the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.this can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (ms), which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.steroid injections are different from the anabolic steroids used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
