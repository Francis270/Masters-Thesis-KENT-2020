steroids






steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
they're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.



types of steroids
steroids come in many different forms.
the main types are:

tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers and nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone 
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone 
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream

most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.



side effects of steroids
steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose. 
but sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. this is most common with steroid tablets.
the side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).

uses for steroids
steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:

asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (ms)




how steroids work
steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
when taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). this can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
this can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
