what happens at your gp appointment
to find out what the cause of your lump or swelling is, the gp may:

look at and feel your testicles
shine a torch through the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) to check for a build-up of fluid 
refer you for an ultrasound scan

treatment for a lump or swelling depends on the cause. you might not need treatment if it doesn't cause any problems and isn't getting worse.
if it's painful or very big, your gp may refer you to a specialist for an operation to drain, shrink or remove it.



causes of testicle lumps and swellings
lumps and swellings in the testicles can have lots of different causes.
most are caused by something harmless, such as a build-up of fluid (cyst) or swollen veins in the testicles (varicocele).
but sometimes they can be a sign of something serious, such as testicular cancer.
don't try to self-diagnose the cause of your lump â€“ always see a gp.
