causes of toothache
toothache can be caused by:

a cracked or damaged tooth 
a loose or broken filling

problems with your braces

the best way to prevent toothache is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. 
to do this:

have regular dental check-ups
cut down on sugary foods and drinks – only have them as an occasional treat at mealtimes
brush your teeth twice a day for about 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste
clean between your teeth using floss or an interdental brush every day to remove food, debris and plaque
