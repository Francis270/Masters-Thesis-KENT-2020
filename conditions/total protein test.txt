total protein test






a total protein test measures the amount of protein in your blood.
proteins are important for the health and growth of the body's cells and tissues.
the test can help diagnose a number of health conditions, including:

kidney disease
liver disease 
malnutrition – a serious condition that occurs when a person's diet doesn't contain enough nutrients to meet their body's needs

if your total protein level is low, you may have a liver or kidney problem, or it may be that protein isn't being digested or absorbed properly.
a high total protein level could indicate dehydration or a certain type of cancer, such as multiple myeloma, that causes protein to accumulate abnormally.
if the result of a total protein test is abnormal, further tests will be needed to identify which proteins are too high or too low. this will enable an accurate diagnosis to be made.
