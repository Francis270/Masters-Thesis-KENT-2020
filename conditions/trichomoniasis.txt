how do you get trichomoniasis?
trichomoniasis is caused by a tiny parasite called trichomonas vaginalis.  in women, this parasite mainly infects the vagina and the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra).in men, the infection most commonly affects the urethra, but the head of the penis or prostate gland, a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen, can become infected in some cases.the parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom.it could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use.you do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.trichomoniasis is not thought to be passed on through oral or anal sex.you also cannot pass on trichomoniasis through:kissing or huggingsharing cups, plates or cutlerytoilet seatsthe best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to have safer sex. this means always using a condom when having sex, covering any sex toys you use with a condom, and washing sex toys after use.




treating trichomoniasis
trichomoniasis is unlikely to go away without treatment, but it can be effectively treated with antibiotics.most men and women are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is usually taken twice a day for 5 to 7 days.it's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up to prevent reinfection.your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated.



complications of trichomoniasiscomplications of trichomoniasis are rare, although some women with the infection may be at an increased risk of further problems.if you're infected with trichomoniasis while you're pregnant, the infection may cause your baby to: be born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)have a low birth weight
