what happens at your appointmentyou'll be asked about your symptoms and may need to give a urine sample to confirm you have a uti.a urine test helps to rule out other conditions that might be causing your symptoms.men are sometimes offered a painless swab test to check for other conditions.this is where a cotton bud is wiped on the tip of the penis and sent for testing. it will not hurt, but may feel uncomfortable.




treating urinary tract infections (utis)
your doctor or nurse may prescribe antibiotics to treat a uti.once you start treatment, the symptoms should start to clear up within 5 days in adults and 2 days in children.it's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.some people with a severe uti may be referred to hospital for treatment and tests. you may need to stay for a few days.hospital treatment is more likely for men and children with a uti.treating recurring utisif your uti comes back any time after treatment, you'll usually be prescribed a longer course of antibiotics.if you keep getting utis and regularly need treatment, your gp may give you a repeat prescription for antibiotics.




things you can do yourself
mild urinary tract infections (utis) often pass within a few days. to help ease pain while your symptoms clear up:take paracetamol – you can give children liquid paracetamolplace a hot water bottle on your tummy, back or between your thighsrest and drink plenty of fluids – this helps your body to flush out the bacteriait may also help to avoid having sex until you feel better.you cannot pass a uti on to your partner, but sex may be uncomfortable.

important
avoid taking nsaids like ibuprofen or aspirin if you have a kidney infection. this may increase the risk of kidney problems.speak to your doctor before you stop taking any prescribed medication.





causes of urinary tract infections (utis)
utis are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract.the bacteria enter through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).women have a shorter urethra than men. this means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection.causes of utis include:pregnancyconditions that block the urinary tract – such as kidney stonesconditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder – such as an enlarged prostate gland in men and constipation in childrenurinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)having a weakened immune system – for example, from type 2 diabetes, chemotherapy or hiv
