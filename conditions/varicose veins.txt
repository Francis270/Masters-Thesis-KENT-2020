causes of varicose veinsvaricose veins develop when the small valves inside the veins stop working properly.in a healthy vein, blood flows smoothly to the heart. the blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through.if the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose).certain things can increase your chances of developing varicose veins, such as:being femalehaving a close family member with varicose veinsbeing olderbeing overweighthaving a job that involves long periods of standingbeing pregnantother conditionsread about the causes of varicose veins.
