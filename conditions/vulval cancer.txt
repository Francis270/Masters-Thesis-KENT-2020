how vulval cancer is treated
the main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.some people may also have radiotherapy, where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells, or chemotherapy, where medicine is used to kill cancer cells, or both.radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you're not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it's not possible to remove it all.



outlookthe outlook for vulval cancer depends on things such as how far the cancer has spread, your age, and your general health.generally, the earlier the cancer is detected and the younger you are, the better the chances of treatment being successful.overall, around 7 in every 10 women diagnosed with vulval cancer will survive at least 5 years.but even after successful treatment, the cancer can come back.you'll need regular follow-up appointments so your doctor can check if this is happening.
