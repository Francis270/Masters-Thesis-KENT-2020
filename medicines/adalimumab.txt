9. common questions




    how does adalimumab work?
    


your immune system naturally produces a protein called tumour necrosis factor (tnf).if your body produces too much tnf, it can cause inflammation.adalimumab stops tnf attaching and attacking healthy cells. this reduces inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases.







    how long does it take to work?
    


it takes a few weeks to work. it may take longer depending on your condition.if you switch to a biosimilar, it'll continue to work straight away.







    what if it does not work?
    


all versions of adalimumab are equally effective and safe.you'll have a review where your specialist checks your condition to see if the medicine is working for you.if it's not working for you, your specialist may increase your dose or give you injections more often.sometimes your condition might change and your body may stop responding to the medicine, so you may need to try a different medicine instead.

    what's the difference between a biological and a biosimilar medicine?
    


a biosimilar medicine is a similar version of a biological medicine.they're as safe and effective as the biological medicine, but tend to be less expensive.they're both made from living cells, so this means there'll be some small natural differences.there might also be a difference in the way the injection syringe or pen works.







    what's the difference between the humira syringe and other adalimumab biosimilar syringes?
