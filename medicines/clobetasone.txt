8. common questions




    how does clobetasone work?
    


clobetasone creams and ointments contain the active ingredient clobetasone butyrate. this is a corticosteroid or "steroid", which reduces inflammation in the skin.the skin gets inflamed when an allergic reaction or irritation causes various chemicals to be released in the skin. these make blood vessels widen and the irritated skin becomes red, swollen, itchy and painful.clobetasone works inside the skin cells to stop the release of these chemicals. this reduces the swelling, redness and itching.







    when will my skin get better?
    


your skin should start to get better after you've used clobetasone for a few days. you may need to use it for a few weeks.







    how long can i use clobetasone for?
    


it depends on why you're using it.for insect bites and stings, nappy rash or contact dermatitis you'll probably only need to use clobetasone for up to a week.for long term skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis you may need to use the medicine for longer under the supervision of a doctor.take a child under 12 years old back to the doctor if they are not better after using clobetasone for 7 days.to reduce the risk of side effects your doctor may recommend using clobetasone for only a few weeks at a time. once your skin is better, use moisturisers to keep it from becoming inflamed again.your doctor may recommend using clobetasone in between a course of strong steroids. this is known as "maintenance therapy" and can keep your condition under control and reduce the risk of side effects.if you've been using clobetasone for a long time you may need to slowly reduce the amount you use and how often before stopping completely. this reduces the chance of your symptoms will flaring up again.talk to you doctor if you want to stop treatment after using clobetasone for a long time.







    why is it not recommended for faces?
    


the skin on your face is delicate so if clobetasone damages it by making the skin thinner, it's more noticeable and you may not be able to make it better.do not use clobetasone on your face unless a doctor says it's ok and has given you a prescription for it. if your doctor has prescribed it for you, it's best to use it on your face for 5 days or less,it's also a good idea to avoid applying clobetasone near the eyes or on your eyelids.some common skin problems that affect the face, such as impetigo, rosacea and acne, can be made worse by clobetasone.







    is it safe to use for a long time?
    


as a general rule, once your skin has settled down your doctor will recommend that you stop using this medicine.if you have been using clobetasone for a long time your doctor may advise you to gradually reduce the amount you use before stopping completely. you can do this by using less clobetasone each time or by using it less often.using clobetasone continuously for a long time can mean some of the medicine gets into your bloodstream. if this happens, there's a very small chance it can cause serious side effects.

yes, you can drink alcohol while using clobetasone.







    is there any food or drink i need to avoid?

clobetasone does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.







    can i drive or ride a bike?
    


clobetasone does not make you sleepy so it's safe to drive or ride a bike when using this medicine.







    can steroids make eczema worse?
    


steroids like clobetasone act by reducing inflammation in the skin to help reduce the symptoms. however, they do not cure the condition.if you feel your symptoms are getting worse after a week of using clobetasone, it's important that you speak to your doctor.when the treatment is stopped, skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis can flare up again.you can avoid this by gradually reducing the amount of cream or ointment you apply, or how often you apply it. do this over a week or two, before stopping it completely.
