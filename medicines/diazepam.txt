it can also be taken to help you relax before an operation or other medical or dental treatments. this is known as a "pre-med".

if you have been prescribed rectal tubes, it's important that a family member, friend or carer knows how to give you this medicine. 
if you're having a fit, they also need to know how long to wait before giving you rectal diazepam.
your doctor will decide the right dose for you or your child according to your weight, age and general health.

take diazepam tablets or liquid with a drink of water. you can take them with or without food. 
you'll usually take your medicine 1 to 3 times a day.
your doctor will decide the right dose for you.  it's important to take diazepam exactly as your doctor tells you to.

sleep problems (related to anxiety) - is 5mg to 15mg taken once a day at bedtime.
muscle spasms in adults - is 2mg to 15 mg a day. this can be given as 1mg twice a day and go up to 5mg 3 times a day. the dose can be increased up to 20mg 3 times a day if needed.
muscle spasm in children (aged 1 month to 17 years) - varies depending on age. it's usually given twice a day, with 10 to 12 hours between each dose.

in this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.
never take 2 doses at the same time. never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.
what if i take too much?
the amount of diazepam that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.

if you take too much diazepam by accident, you may experience symptoms including:

poor co-ordination or trouble speaking
feeling sleepy
a slow or irregular heartbeat 
uncontrolled eye movements
muscle weakness 
feeling overexcited

if you need to go to a&e, do not drive yourself. get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.
take the diazepam packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.





5. side effects
like all medicines, diazepam can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.
common side effects
these common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people.
if you get these side effects, keep taking the medicine and speak to your doctor:

feeling sleepy or drowsy
confusion
problems with your co-ordination or controlling your movements
shaky hands (tremors)

serious side effects
it happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking diazepam.

your breathing becomes very slow or shallow 
your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow
you find it difficult to remember things (amnesia)
you see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations)
you think things that are not true (delusions)

tell your doctor if you notice any of these side effects:

talking too much or feeling overexcited
feeling agitated or restless
feeling irritable or aggressive

serious allergic reaction
in rare cases, diazepam may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).

you're wheezing

information: 
you can report any suspected side effect to the uk safety scheme.




6. how to cope with side effects
if you feel sleepy or drowsy, do not drive or use tools or machinery until you feel better. do not drink any alcohol. 
this side effect should get better as your body gets used to the medicine. 
if your symptoms do not improve after a week, speak to a doctor as you may need a lower dose. 
if you experience any other side effect, speak to your doctor.



7. pregnancy and breastfeeding
there's not enough information to know if diazepam is safe to use in pregnancy. but it can give your newborn baby withdrawal symptoms.
if you become pregnant while taking diazepam, speak to your doctor.
you may need to keep taking diazepam during pregnancy as it's important for you to remain well. 
your doctor can explain the risks and the benefits of taking diazepam, and will help you choose the best treatment for you and your baby.
diazepam and breastfeeding
if your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, diazepam can be used during breastfeeding as long as you're only taking a low dose of diazepam occasionally or for a very short time.
diazepam passes into breast milk. if you take diazepam for a long time or in high doses, it can build up in your milk. this can make your baby drowsy or tired and can make it difficult for them to feed.
if you're breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist, as other medicines might be better while breastfeeding, although this will depend on what the diazepam is being used for.
if you do take diazepam while you're breastfeeding and you notice that your baby's not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy, has unusual breathing, or you have any other concerns about them, talk to your health visitor or doctor as soon as possible.






non-urgent advice:  tell your doctor if you're:
