6. how to cope with side effects
what to do about:

difficulty sleeping - try taking duloxetine first thing in the morning 
headaches - make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. do not drink too much alcohol. ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe. 
feeling dizzy -  if duloxetine makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. if you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint, then sit until you feel better. do not drive or use tools or machines if you feel dizzy, have muscle cramps or muscle pain, or if you just feel a bit shaky.
blurred vision - avoid driving or using tools or machines while this is happening. if it lasts for more than a day or two, speak to your doctor as they may need to change your treatment.
constipation - try to eat more high-fibre foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. try to exercise more regularly by going for a daily walk or run, for example. if this does not help, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.
diarrhoea - drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor first.
feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting) - stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. make sure you take duloxetine in the morning with some food and try small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.
dry mouth - chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets 
sweating - try wearing loose clothing, use a strong anti-perspirant, and keep cool using a fan if possible. if this does not help, you may need to try a different type of antidepressant.
tiredness - do not drive or use tools or machinery if you're feeling this way. try taking duloxetine 1 hour before bedtime. cut down the amount of alcohol you drink as this will make you feel more tired. if this symptom does not go away after a week or two, ask your doctor for advice.
less appetite than usual and weight loss - this side effect should get better as your body gets used to the medicine. it may also help to eat smaller meals more often and eat foods you really enjoy. if your appetite does not improve or you lose a lot of weight, ask your doctor for advice.
feeling less interested in sex, or having problems keeping an erection or reaching orgasm - speak to your doctor if you experience this side effect and it does not go away.




7. pregnancy and breastfeeding
it's important for you and your baby that you stay well during your pregnancy. 
there's no firm evidence that duloxetine is harmful to an unborn baby. but for safety, pregnant women are usually advised to only take it if the benefits of the medicine outweigh the potential risks. 
if you become pregnant while taking duloxetine, speak to your doctor. do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. 
if you need to take duloxetine during pregnancy to remain well, your doctor can explain the risks and the benefits to help you decide which treatment is best for you and your baby. 
for more information about how duloxetine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read the leaflet on the best use of medicines in pregnancy (bumps) website.
duloxetine and breastfeeding
if your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, duloxetine may be used during breastfeeding.  
duloxetine passes into breast milk in very small amounts, but it's not known if it's harmful to the baby.
it's important to continue taking duloxetine to keep you well. breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby. 
if you notice that your baby's not feeding as well as usual or seems unusually sleepy, or you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your health visitor or doctor as soon as possible.

medication used to thin the blood, such as warfarin 
diazepam, chlorphenamine or other medication that can make you feel more sleepy 
tramadol â€“ this can increase the chances of you having certain side effects 

mixing duloxetine with herbal remedies and supplements
do not take the herbal remedy st john's wort while you're being treated with duloxetine, as this will increase your risk of side effects.

9. common questions




    how does duloxetine work?
    


duloxetine is a type of antidepressant known as a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (snri).
snris are thought to work by increasing the amount of mood-enhancing chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain.







    when will i feel better?
    


you may see an improvement after 2 to 4 weeks. improvements for nerve pain may take longer. 
do not stop taking duloxetine after a week or two just because you feel it's not helping your symptoms. 
give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.







    how will it make me feel?
    


antidepressants like duloxetine help to gradually lift your mood so you feel better. 
you may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. 
you'll hopefully take things that used to worry you in your stride.
do not expect to feel better overnight, though. some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better. 
if you're taking it for nerve pain or urinary incontinence, you may also notice some of these feelings.







    how long will i take it for?
    


how long you take it for depends on why you're taking it.

for depression or anxiety - once you're feeling better, it's likely that you'll continue to take duloxetine for several more months. most doctors recommend that you take antidepressants for 6 months to a year after you no longer feel depressed or anxious. stopping your medicine too soon can make depression and anxiety come back. 
for nerve pain or urinary incontinence - if duloxetine is helping your symptoms, you can continue taking it long term. your doctor may check that you're still having relief from the pain or urinary incontinence every few months.








    is it safe to take it for a long time?
    


yes, duloxetine is safe to take for a long time.







    how do i come off duloxetine?
    


if you have been feeling better for 6 months or more, your doctor may suggest coming off duloxetine.
your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks, or longer if you have been taking duloxetine for a long time.
this is to help prevent any extra side effects you might get as a reaction to coming off the medicine.
these include:

dizziness
feeling sick
numbness or tingling in the hands or feet
trouble sleeping
feeling agitated or anxious
headaches
shaking


important
do not stop taking duloxetine suddenly or without talking to your doctor first.








    how does duloxetine compare to other antidepressants?
    


duloxetine is not any better or worse than other antidepressants. 
sometimes people respond better to one treatment than to another. 
if you're not feeling any better after 6 weeks, talk to your doctor.







    are there other treatments that'll help?
    


taking antidepressants, including duloxetine, is just one of many ways to treat depression and anxiety.
other potential treatments include:

talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)
exercise programmes
help to get a good night's sleep

choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:

how long you have had depression
your symptoms
whether you have had any previous periods of depression
whether previous treatment has worked
how likely you are to stick with your treatment
the potential side effects
your preferences and priorities

there are also other ways to treat nerve pain and urinary incontinence.
if duloxetine is not working for you, speak to your doctor - there may be other treatments you can try.







    is there any food or drink i need to avoid?
    


you can eat and drink normally while taking duloxetine.







    will i gain or lose weight?
    


duloxetine can make you feel less hungry, so you may lose weight. 
if you start to have problems with your weight while taking duloxetine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.







    can i drink alcohol with it?
    


yes, you can drink alcohol, but it may make you feel sleepy or tired. 
during the first few days of taking duloxetine, it might be best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.







    will it affect my fertility?
    


there's no firm evidence to suggest that taking duloxetine will reduce fertility in either men or women.
but speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.
speak to your doctor if you're planning to get pregnant while taking duloxetine.







    will it affect my contraception?
    


duloxetine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.







    can i drive or ride a bike?
    


some people cannot concentrate properly while they're taking duloxetine. 
when you first start taking duloxetine, it's a good idea to stop driving and cycling, and avoid using machines or tools, for the first few days until you know how this medicine makes you feel.







    will recreational drugs affect it?
    


cannabis can affect the levels of duloxetine and make you more likely to get side effects.
it can be potentially dangerous to take duloxetine with: 

stimulants like mdma (ecstasy) or cocaine 
hallucinogens like lsd 
novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone


important
duloxetine has not been properly tested with recreational drugs.
talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking duloxetine.
