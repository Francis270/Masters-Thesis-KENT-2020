3. who can and can't use lidocaine for mouth and throat
most adults and young people over the age of 16 years can use lidocaine for mouth and throat. there are also lidocaine products that are suitable for children and babies. 
teething treatments are for babies from the age of 5 months or 6 months, depending on the brand. always check the packaging and instructions before giving lidocaine to a baby. 
lidocaine products can look very similar. some are only suitable for people over the age of 16 years. this is because they contain choline salicylate (an ingredient related to aspirin).

gel for teething

squeeze a small amount of teething gel onto your finger or a cotton bud.
