1. about linagliptin
linagliptin is a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. 
type 2 diabetes is an illness where the body does not make enough insulin, or the insulin that it makes does not work properly. this can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia).
linagliptin is prescribed for people who still have high blood sugar, even though they have a sensible diet and exercise regularly. 
linagliptin is only available on prescription. 
it comes as tablets that you swallow. it also comes as tablets containing a mixture of linagliptin and metformin. metformin is another drug used to treat diabetes.



2. key facts

linagliptin works by increasing the amount of insulin that your body makes. insulin is the hormone that controls sugar levels in your blood.
you take linagliptin once a day.
most people have no side effects, or only minor ones, when taking linagliptin.
it will not usually make you put on or lose weight. 
linagliptin is also called by the brand names trajenta and (when mixed with metformin) jentadueto.




3. who can and can't take linagliptin
linagliptin can be taken by adults (aged 18 years and older).  
linagliptin is not suitable for some people. to make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor if you:

have had an allergic reaction to linagliptin or any other medicines in the past
have (or have previously had) problems with your pancreas
are pregnant or breastfeeding, or trying to get pregnant

this medicine is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (when your body does not produce insulin).



4. how and when to take it
take linagliptin once a day. 
you can take it at any time - for example, in the morning or in the evening. just try to take it at the same time every day. 
swallow the tablet whole, without breaking it. 
how much will i take?
linagliptin comes as 5mg tablets. 
the usual dose is 5mg a day.
what if i take too much?






urgent advice: call a doctor if  you take too much linagliptin and:
      





have  stomach pains
are feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)
feel dizzy
are worried




what if i forget to take it?
take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose. 
never take 2 tablets on the same day. 
if you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. 
you could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicines.



5. side effects
like all medicines, linagliptin can cause side effects in some people. but most people have no side effects, or only minor ones, when taking it.
talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you get any side effects that bother you or do not go away.
serious side effects
it happens rarely, but some people may have serious side effects after taking linagliptin.
call your doctor straight away if you have:

severe stomach pains
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow

low blood sugar
linagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or "hypos") when taken on its own. 
but hypos can happen when you take linagliptin with other diabetes medicines, such as insulin or gliclazide.
early warning signs of low blood sugar include:

feeling hungry
trembling or shaking
sweating
confusion
difficulty concentrating

it's also possible for your blood sugar to go too low while you're asleep. 
if this happens, it can make you feel sweaty, tired and confused when you wake up.
low blood sugar may happen if you:

take too much of some types of diabetes medicines
eat meals irregularly or skip meals
are fasting
do not eat a healthy diet and are not getting enough nutrients
change what you eat
increase your physical activity without eating more to compensate
drink alcohol, especially after skipping a meal
take some other medicines or herbal medicines at the same time
have a hormone disorder, such as hypothyroidism
have kidney or liver problems

to prevent hypos, it's important to have regular meals, including breakfast. never miss or delay a meal.
if you're planning to exercise more than usual, make sure you eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or cereals before, during or after exercise.
always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. artificial sweeteners will not help. 
you may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.
if taking in sugar does not help or the hypo symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.
make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar levels so they can recognise a hypo if it happens.
serious allergic reaction
it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to linagliptin.






immediate action required: call 999 or go to a&e if:
      





you get a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin
you're wheezing
you get tightness in the chest or throat
you have trouble breathing or talking
your mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat start swelling

you could be having a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.

8. common questions




    how does linagliptin work?
    


linagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors (dpp-4 inhibitors) or gliptins.
it's used to treat type 2 diabetes, which is caused by problems with a hormone in your body called insulin. 
gliptins help your body make more insulin. they also stop your body releasing too much sugar (glucose) into your blood. 
both of these things help keep your blood sugar levels stable.







    how long does it take to work?
    


linagliptin starts to work within a few hours. 
you need to take it every day to make sure your blood sugar stays as stable as possible.







    how long will i take linagliptin for? can i come off it?
    


linagliptin helps keep your blood sugar level as normal as possible to prevent health problems. 
you'll probably have to take it for a long time, even for the rest of your life. 
over time it gets harder to control blood sugar levels, so your doctor might eventually recommend stopping linagliptin and trying a different treatment. 
do not stop taking linagliptin without speaking to your doctor.







    does it cause hypoglycaemia ('hypos')?
    


linagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or "hypos") when taken on its own. 
if you're taking other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose of your other medicines when you start linagliptin. this will reduce the risk of hypos.







    is it safe to take long term?
    


linagliptin is safe to take for a long time. 
there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months, or even years.

linagliptin is a dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor (dpp-4 inhibitor). 
similar medicines include alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin.
there are other diabetes medicines that you swallow, such as metformin, gliclazide, glimepiride, pioglitazone, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.







    are there different types of diabetes medicines?
    


there are several medicines that can lower blood sugar levels:

metformin
sulphonylureas, like gliclazide
pioglitazone
dpp-4 inhibitors, like linagliptin
sglt2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin
glp-1 agonists like exenatide (given by injection)
insulin (given by injection)

your doctor might recommend taking more than one type of diabetes medicine at the same time.







    can i get diabetes medicines for free?

    can i drink alcohol with it?
    


yes, you can drink alcohol while taking linagliptin. 
but it's best to drink no more than 2 units a day. drinking more than this can increase your risk of low blood sugar.
try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. 
a standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. a pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.
