important
do not break, crush, chew or suck morphine slow-release tablets or capsules. if you do, the slow-release system won't work and the whole dose might get into your body in one go. this could cause a potentially fatal overdose.


will my dose go up or down?usually, you start on a low dose of morphine and this is increased slowly until your pain is well controlled. once your pain is under control, talk to your doctor about swapping to slow-release morphine. this may cut down the number of doses you have to take each day.when you stop taking morphine your dose will go down gradually, especially if you've been taking it for a long time.how long will i take it for?depending on why you're taking morphine, you may only need to take it for a short time. for example, if you're in pain after an injury or operation, you may only need to take morphine for a few days or weeks at most. you may need to take it for longer if you have a long-term condition such as back pain.what if i forget to take it?this will vary depending on which type of morphine you're taking.if you forget to take a dose, check the information on the patient information leaflet inside the packaging or ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice on what to do.never take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.if you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. you could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.what will happen if i stop taking it?if you need to take morphine for a long time your body can become tolerant to it.this isn't usually a problem but you could get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly.if you want to stop taking morphine, talk to your doctor first. your dose can be reduced gradually so you don't get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.if you stop taking morphine suddenly it can cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms such as:feeling agitatedfeeling anxiousshakingsweating

10. common questions




    how does morphine work?
    


morphine is from a group of medicines called opiates, or narcotics.it works in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. it also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.when morphine blocks the pain, there are other unwanted effects - for example slow or shallow breathing. it also slows down digestion, which is why morphine can cause constipation.







    how long will it take to work?
    


this depends on the type of morphine you take.a morphine injection into a vein gives the quickest pain relief. it works almost straight away.fast-acting morphine taken by mouth works in 30 to 60 minutes but it wears off after 4 to 6 hours. slow-acting morphine taken by mouth can take a day or 2 to start working but the pain relief will last for longer.it's difficult to say how long morphine suppositories take to work, as it varies from person to person.







    can i become addicted to morphine?
    


yes, morphine is addictive. if you need to take it for a long time your body can become tolerant to it. that means you need higher doses to control your pain.but in reality, if you're taking morphine to relieve pain (rather than using it as a recreational drug) it's very unlikely you will get addicted to it because you're not taking it to get a "high".







    how will i know if i'm addicted?
    


if you're addicted to morphine, you may find it difficult to stop taking it or feel you need to take it more often than necessary.and if you stop taking morphine suddenly you may suffer from withdrawal symptoms. these include agitation, anxiety, nervousness, panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, shaking, over-activity, pins and needles or ringing in the ears.talk to your doctor if you're worried about addiction or if you want to know more about how to prevent withdrawal symptoms.







    is morphine a controlled medicine?
    


morphine is a controlled medicine. this means there are strict rules on how it's prescribed and dispensed to make sure it's not given to the wrong person or misused.when you collect morphine your pharmacist will ask for proof of your identity such as your passport or driving licence. you'll also be asked to sign the back of your prescription, to confirm that you've received it.if you're collecting morphine for someone else, you're legally required to show the pharmacist proof of your identity if asked.







    how can i tell if i am taking slow or fast release morphine?
    


fast-acting morphine tablets are also known as sevredol. slow-acting tablets are also known as mst continus or morphgesic sr. slow-acting capsules are also known as mxl or zomorph.







    will it affect my fertility?
    


there's no firm evidence to suggest that taking morphine will reduce fertility in men.however, it may interfere with your periods (menstrual cycle) if you're a woman. speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant. they may want to review your treatment.







    will it affect my contraception?
    


morphine doesn't affect any type of contraception including the contraceptive pill or emergency contraception.







    can i drink alcohol with it?
    


it may be best not to drink alcohol while taking morphine as drinking alcohol while you're on morphine may make you feel more sleepy or increase the risk of serious side effects.it's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of treatment until you see how the morphine affects you.if you feel sleepy with morphine, stop drinking alcohol while you are taking it.







    are there other painkillers i can try?
    


the type of painkiller that's best depends on what type of pain you have and the cause of your pain. if morphine doesn't get rid of your pain or becomes less effective, discuss this with your doctor.







    will it make me so sleepy i can't function?
    


when you first take morphine, you'll probably feel sleepy for a few days. but the sleepiness will wear off after a few days as your body gets used to the medicine.you might notice you are less alert. in this case, you might choose to have less than perfect pain relief as a trade-off.







    is morphine only used at the end of life?
    


morphine isn't only used at the end of a terminal illness. it's the amount of pain you have, not the stage of your illness, that decides whether morphine is prescribed for you.







    can children take morphine?
    


morphine can be used safely in babies and children of all ages, although the dose is usually lower than for adults.







    can i drive or ride a bike?
    


do not drive a car or ride a bike if morphine makes you sleepy during the daytime, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions. this may be more likely when you first start taking morphine but could happen at any time - for example when starting another medicine.it's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. it's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. if you're in any doubt, do not drive.it may be best not to drink alcohol while taking morphine as you're more likely to get side effects like feeling sleepy.even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much morphine is in your body. gov.uk has more information on the law on drugs and driving.talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking morphine.







    will recreational drugs affect it?
    


if you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, while you're taking morphine, you're more likely to get the serious side effects of morphine including breathing difficulties, heart problems such as high blood pressure, seizures and even going into a coma.some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, will also increase morphine side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness.taking heroin while you're on prescribed morphine is especially dangerous. you're more likely to get all the side effects of morphine, including addiction.tell your doctor if you think you may take recreational drugs while you're on morphine.
