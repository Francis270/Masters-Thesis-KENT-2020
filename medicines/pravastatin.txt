8. common questions




    how does pravastatin work?

    what will happen if i come off it?
    


you may want to stop pravastatin if you think you're having side effects. talk to your doctor first to see if it really is a side effect of pravastatin or an unrelated problem. your doctor may decide to lower your dose or change your medicine.

    will taking pravastatin increase my risk of diabetes?
    


if you're at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, taking statins may slightly increase this risk. this is because statins can raise your blood sugar a little. 
speak to your doctor, who will be able to explain how the benefits of taking statins are likely to outweigh this small increased risk.
if you already have type 2 diabetes, your doctor may advise monitoring your blood sugar levels more closely for the first few months. tell your doctor or diabetes nurse if you find it harder to control your blood sugar.







    how does it compare with other medicines for high cholesterol?
    


statins all work in the same way, but they differ in how well they lower cholesterol.

simvastatin
fluvastatin
atorvastatin
rosuvastatin

if you have a side effect with one statin, it may not happen with another. some medicines don't mix well with one statin, but you can take them with a different one.
