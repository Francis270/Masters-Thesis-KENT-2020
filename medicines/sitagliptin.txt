1. about sitagliptin
sitagliptin is a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes is an illness where the body does not make enough insulin, or the insulin that it makes does not work properly. 
this can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia).
sitagliptin is prescribed for people who still have high blood sugar, even though they have a sensible diet and exercise regularly. 
sitagliptin is only available on prescription. 
it comes as tablets that you swallow. it also comes as tablets containing a mixture of sitagliptin and metformin. metformin is another drug used to treat diabetes.



2. key facts

this medicine is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (when your body does not produce insulin).

your doctor might give you a lower dose of 25mg or 50mg a day if you have problems with your kidneys.
what if i take too much?

if you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. 
you could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.



5. side effects
like all medicines, sitagliptin can cause side effects in some people. 
but many people have no side effects, or only minor ones. 
common side effects
the most common side effects, which happen in more than 1 in 100 people, are headaches. 
talk to your doctor if headaches last longer than a week or are severe.
if taking sitagliptin gives you a headache, make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. do not drink too much alcohol. 
ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. 
serious side effects
it happens rarely, but some people may have serious side effects after taking sitagliptin.
call your doctor straight away if you have:

severe stomach pains
yellowing of your skin, or the whites of your eyes turn yellow

low blood sugar
sitagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or "hypos") when taken on its own. 
but hypos can happen when you take sitagliptin with other diabetes medicines, such as insulin or gliclazide.
early warning signs of low blood sugar include:

feeling hungry
trembling or shaking
sweating
confusion
difficulty concentrating

it's also possible for your blood sugar to go too low while you're asleep. 
if this happens, it can make you feel sweaty, tired and confused when you wake up.
low blood sugar may happen if you:

take too much of some types of diabetes medicines
eat meals irregularly or skip meals
are fasting
do not eat a healthy diet and are not getting enough nutrients
change what you eat
increase your physical activity without eating more to compensate
drink alcohol, especially after skipping a meal
take some other medicines or herbal medicines at the same time
have a hormone disorder, such as hypothyroidism
have kidney or liver problems

it's important to have regular meals, including breakfast, to prevent hypoglycaemia. never miss or delay a meal.
if you're planning to exercise more than usual, make sure you eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or  cereals before, during or after exercise.
always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. artificial sweeteners will not help. 
you may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.
if taking in sugar does not help or the hypo symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.
make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar levels so they can recognise a hypo if it happens.
serious allergic reaction
it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to sitagliptin.






immediate action required: call 999 or go to a&e if:
      





you get a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin
you're wheezing
you get tightness in the chest or throat
you have trouble breathing or talking
your mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat start swelling

you could be having a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.

8. common questions




    how does sitagliptin work?
    


sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors (dpp-4 inhibitors) or gliptins.
it's used to treat type 2 diabetes, which is caused by problems with a hormone in your body called insulin. 
gliptins help your body make more insulin. they also stop your body releasing too much sugar (glucose) into your blood.
both of these things help keep your blood sugar levels stable.







    how long does it take to work?
    


sitagliptin starts to work within a few hours. 
you need to take it every day to make sure your blood sugar stays as stable as possible.







    how long will i take sitagliptin for? can i come off it?
    


sitagliptin helps keep your blood sugar level as normal as possible to prevent health problems. 
you'll probably have to take it for a long time, even for the rest of your life. 
over time it gets harder to control blood sugar levels, so your doctor might eventually recommend stopping sitagliptin and trying a different treatment. 
do not stop taking sitagliptin without speaking to your doctor.







    does it cause hypoglycaemia ('hypos')?
    


sitagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or "hypos") when taken on its own. 
if you're taking other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose of your other medicines when you start sitagliptin. 
this will reduce the risk of hypos.







    is it safe to take long term?
    


sitagliptin is safe to take for a long time. there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months or even years.
you may have seen news stories linking sitagliptin with pancreatic cancer. but there's no firm evidence that sitagliptin causes cancer.

sitagliptin is a dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor (dpp-4 inhibitor). 
similar medicines include alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin.
there are other diabetes medicines that you swallow, such as metformin, gliclazide, glimepiride, pioglitazone, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.







    are there different types of diabetes medicines?
    


there are several medicines that can lower blood sugar levels:

metformin
sulphonylureas, like gliclazide
pioglitazone
dpp-4 inhibitors, like sitagliptin
sglt2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin
glp-1 agonists, like exenatide (given by injection)

    can i drink alcohol with it?
    


yes, you can drink alcohol while taking sitagliptin.
