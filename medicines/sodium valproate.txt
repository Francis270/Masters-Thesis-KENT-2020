9. common questions




    how does sodium valproate work?
    


sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. it prevents epileptic fits by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.we don't fully understand how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. however, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) in the brain. gaba blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.it's not really clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. it may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.







    when will i feel better?
    


it takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. you may still have symptoms during this time.







    how long will i take it for?
    


once your illness is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.







    can i get addicted to sodium valproate?
    


sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.







    is it safe to take it for a long time?
    


many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.however, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.







    can i get epilepsy medicines for free?
    


if you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).to claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.the application form for the medical exemption certificate is called fp92a. you can get this from your doctor's surgery. you will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.







    are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?
    


valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. they work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.if you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.







    how does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?
    


there are many different medicines for treating epilepsy (anti-epileptic medicines). it's not possible to say that one works better than the other. it varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and gender, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you may have.it's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine.â€¯if this medicine isn't working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will generally try you on a different one.if a single medicine isn't preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.sodium valproate works for quite a few different types of epilepsy. if it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it isn't suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.other anti-epileptic medicines include:carbamazepineclobazamethosuximidegabapentinlamotriginelevetiracetamphenytoinpregabalintopiramate







    how does it compare with other medicines for migraine?
    


for many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. these medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects - so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.sodium valproate isnâ€™t used as often for preventing migraine. however, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or aren't working for you.your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you can't take other migraine medicines.







    how does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?
    


if you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. it's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. you can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. it depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.







    should i stick to the same type of sodium valproate?
    


once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. this is because it can be a problem to swap from "modified release" to "gastro resistant" tablets.some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate - for example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. if you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.however, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.







    what will happen when i come off it?
    


do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.you're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. however, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. you can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.if you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.

sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.if you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.

drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. for this reason it's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.if you do drink, try not to have more than the recommended guidelines of up to 14 units of alcohol a week. a standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. a pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.
