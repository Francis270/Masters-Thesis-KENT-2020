6. how to cope with side effects

disturbed sleep (such as vivid dreams) - speak to your doctor; they may suggest a different medicine or a lower dose.
feeling lightheaded, unsteady or dizzy - try to lie down or sit down until it passes. do not try to drive or use machinery until you feel completely normal again. if the symptoms do not disappear after a few days or get worse, consult your doctor.
feeling drowsy, tired, less alert or "hungover" the next day - speak to your doctor; they may suggest a lower dose. do not drive or use machinery until you feel better.
dry mouth - if this bothers you, try taking sips of water and keep some water by your bed at night. using a mouthwash before bedtime may also help. ask your pharmacist to recommend one that's good for a dry mouth, as some can make a dry mouth worse.




7. pregnancy and breastfeeding
temazepam is not usually recommended during pregnancy. 
if you become pregnant while taking temazepam, speak to your doctor. they'll want to review your medicine.
you may need to keep taking temazepam during pregnancy to remain well. 
your doctor can explain the risks and the benefits to help you decide which treatment is best for you and your baby.
breastfeeding
if you're having sleeping problems, talk to your doctor or pharmacist as there may be other ways of improving your sleep that do not involve taking temazepam.
but if your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, temazepam can be used during breastfeeding at low doses occasionally, or for a short time.   
temazepam passes into breast milk in small amounts, but it's unlikely to cause any side effects in your baby. 
if you take temazepam while you're breastfeeding and you notice that your baby's not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy, or you have any other concerns about them, talk to your health visitor or doctor as soon as possible.

this may be more likely when you first start taking temazepam, but could happen at any time - for example, when starting another medicine.
it's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. 
it's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. if you're in any doubt, do not drive.
even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much temazepam is in your body.

the gov.uk website has a full list of foreign embassies in the uk.







    will recreational drugs affect it?
    


using cannabis with temazepam will make its sleep-inducing effects worse.
you could go into a very deep sleep, where you have difficulty waking up.
using heroin or methadone with temazepam may also increase the sedative effects of both of them.
again, you could go into a very deep sleep and have difficulty waking up.

    can lifestyle changes help?
    


there are a number of things you can do to help yourself beat insomnia:

set regular times for going to bed and waking up
relax before bedtime - try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music
use thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise
avoid caffeine, cigarettes (or e-cigarettes), alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed
do not watch tv or use phones, tablets or computers just before going to bed
do not nap during the day
write a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before you go to bed to help you forget about them until the morning


important
do not take any medicines or herbal remedies that make you feel sleepy while taking temazepam.
they can increase the drowsy-making (sedating) effects of your medicine.
